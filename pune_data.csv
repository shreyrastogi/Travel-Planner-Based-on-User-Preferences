Photos are allowed to be taken. Canteen service also available over here. Having visited this place during after hours, it was closed so we only paid a visit from the outside. The outside was pretty cool, we can see the palace structure and the marvelous garden from there. The gate looked secure, but not very much. An average place to visit if you have time nothing new in this museum. Place is impotent because of history events. I visited this place with my client and was under-whelmed at best... this is a beautiful property and has so much history associated with it.. however the whole idea of it being almost unattended means the overall visit doesnt awe you with its historical significance... A big palace but in need of better maintenance.Exhibition too needs better maintenance. Many of the area are closed. Grounds with huge trees are treat to watch. It is good for 1-2 hours. Quiet place and well maintained. Lot of greenery around and you tend to go back to an era. This was the place where Mahatma Gandhiji was kept in home arrest
All his things are still there in the room he has used 
The garden is very beautiful with so many trees around you feel calm at once you enter
Though they could pay... The place is quite calm and quite just on Nagar Road. Enough space to spend the late afternoon or early evening. It's a historical place and you also spend some time in sitting there and enjoy the surrounding. Historical importance. Gandhi was held in this palace by British. His close people stayed with him as well. Many things which Gandhi used in daily life has been displayed + Historical notes with pictures explaining further gives a fair walkthrough as well. Good tourist place.  With a lot of history.  Unfortunately it's not well conserved.  Pune could take more attention to their history. The Aga Khan Palace is situated opposite Phoenix Market City,  about 2 kms before it.  It is the place where The Mahatma was interned for two years from 42-44. This place is a must see to understand The Mahatma and his awesome simplicity! Canteen has juices,shake and snacks.Knowledgable place to remember the history focused on Mahatma Gandhiji jail stay and death of his wife and followers. Lots of history to go over when you visit this place. It would be nice if there were audio guides though. We were lucky to have gone with two local people, otherwise, it would have been utterly boring and less significant. The museum is a bit ordinary but you do get a good overview of Gandhi's time there. The best part is knowing that you are walking where the great man and his wife and followers were. The gardens and building are superb and well worth... Lovely place visited with my wife and Kidos, enjoyed a lottttt.

Will visit again with my whole family Interesting place to learn about the life of Gandhi, his wife, and his secretary during the period in which he was in prison at Aga Khan Palace. Highly recommend. Nice palace well maintain and clean place. One of the most visited place by tourist in Pune. Nice well maintain garden. A grand Memorial but lacking in upkeep. The exhibits need some dusting and place kept neat and clean.
The canteen is shoddy may not appeal to visitors from abroad.
The sales counter also lacks charm.

A pleasant walk around the grounds and some interesting detail about the internment of Ghandi and his wife during the 'Quit India' campaign. Exhibitions more concerns with the construction of the national myth than being informative about the significance of the place. Overpriced for foreigners.

The history of this site is more fascinating than the site itself. The grounds are lovely and calming - plus there's free parking - so it's a great place for a stroll or to just escape the city for a bit. 

The house is beautiful... Good place to drown yourself in history.
well maintain campus and main building.
Photos and other historian arts are not maintained as it should.

His wife and secretary passed away during these period... Apart from the garden and the exterior of the palace (and only reason why I give 2 stars), the place is in serious need of a new management and maintenance.

Monuments and garden... Great and peace place in city ! But it's hard to get food when you are hungry ! Although place is very heritage and history connected ! Need more care and something which leads people come and make it crowded !

But this place is a must visit if you want some calm environment in your chaotic lifestyle+ you will get a lot of historic insight.

Entry Fee: 15 Ruppes (INR)
Paid Parking... It is type of museum of Gandhiji used things. Gandhiji's mother grave is also here. It requires 10rs ticket to enter ana Khan place for Indians. Place worth a visit , place needs a revamp though. Nice photographs of Gandhiji and some of his personal effects. Clearly a thought provoking place for those who don't know this is where Ghandi and his wife were imprisoned, she died and his ashes are here.

Only R200 to enter the museum and gardens are well worth a visit if you are in Pune. It's a boring place. Just good for sitting in the lawn to spend some peaceful time. Nothing is there to see in the palace apart from some Gandhiji statues. Better to avoid. Phoenix mall is 500m away. This is the place where Gandhiji spen 2 years in prison.His wife Kasturba Gandi and secratery Mahadev died here.Their memorial stones can be found.The palace is completely built with wood.The only place in Pune with huge park where you can sit and relax. The Aga Khan Palace is more of stately home than a palace - respect goes to the Aga Khan and his strong bonding with India and her leaders.

Old & dusted, not very well maintained.

Gandhiji and Kasturba's room is the most famous also you can see almost each and every historic items gandhiji were using in those days. must visit place. Nice and silent park area. Important and interesting historical place. Natives have to pay Rs 15 as entry fee, the guard scans the Bar Code on your ticket and validates you to enter. This was quite a thing to see.
Overall, a good place to... Located at central of Pune and spread over 19 acres, this palace is actually Mahatma Gandhi museum. This is a great place to spend 1-2 hours with family at afternoon. This Palace must have been magnificent in its time. Sadly it is very run down and the gardens are not a patch on what they must have been like. It was worth going to learn about Ghandi's journey.

I was expecting more Here you will see things associated with Mahatama Gandhi. They have mainted it well and the fare for indian tourist is minimal. You can avoid buying stuff near MG and her wife's cementry. great property but neglected place ,just can visit for knowledge or tribute to bapuji & to know more about his struggle for freedom fight The Palace is a lovely building with a real sense of history and set in a nice little park.

This is one of the historical monuments, which has been grossly neglected... Not much to see....One may want to give this a miss, if tight on schedule... The palace was simple but carried some very interesting history about Gandhi and his wife.  The tour is short and self-guided, but available in English. Though it's not mis-leading but I guess the name of this place should be changed from a Palace to something that depicts its association with Gandhi Ji as there is really nothing in it about Sir Aga Khan or his life in a Palace.

Something... Visited this place as part of kids school assignment.
It was very peaceful visit. It has a small museum of Mahatma Gandhi - lots of information & old pictures of Gandhi.
Garden also is very good. Many different trees & colorful flower plants all over... Aga Khan palace reveals the past of sad demise of kasturba gandhi after house arrest given by Britishers.

Its nicely maintained with large green area around. Very quiet and peaceful place. It chronicles important days in the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Overall good experience, highly recommended. Not much to see in the palace, and even outside of the palace.
Felt not worth to pay 100rupee for it. There was a english speaking guide who had studied in the palace when she was a child....the way she conducted the tour was really very interesting....did not know that Kasturba Ghandhi burial place was in the palace grounds. The gardens were really nice. It is a small palace with access to  a few rooms used by Gandhi during his internment for two years over part of WW2. Shows various pictures and few possessions owned by Gandhi. His personal secretary and wife passed away there too and their ashes... Interesting place to visit, certainly to gain understanding of Gandhi's time there.

The grounds are beautiful.  It is worth a visit. Half an hour... Not many people know of this monument of great historic value which is well maintained. It takes you through Gandhiji's life when he was imprisoned at Aga Khan Plalace. It is a must see for children. d infrastructure is average, the guards r rude lack of cleanliness, the area  is also small , i cant say more It is really a good place to visit. It is very calm & clean place to visit.
You can visit with family and friends. There is nothing there... its two room museum....But since there are much options within pune to visit.....

As they are charging visitors, video documentary should be shown about importance and incidence associated with this place. Just visit the place and sit for hours with your family. very much pleasant. Peaceful Place in Crowded City and Nagar Road If this kind of place with so much historical significance existed in Europe it would have been a most sought after destination.Sadly, here in Pune this place is hardly advertised, is not tourist friendly, lacks upkeep and is poorly manned A very nice place to look back at history and learn about few details of Gandhi's life. 

The entry fee is just 5 rupees and is worth every penny. The information available in the rooms shows how Gandhi was attached to his secretary, Desai. It is supposed to be palace but it isn't. They have just spoilt the place by making it a place full of kitsch. I was thoroughly disappointed. A great monument - historically relevant and culturally sensitive.
The gardens are sprawling and reasonably well maintained  - so you can even get away for a stroll.
More guides would be welcome - right now the volunteers are doing a great job Run down .you see  about 3 rooms on the bottom floor and thats it.What should be a great experince is a total let down
Really needs to be overhauled and opened up- why limit the experience to a few rooms? Grounds are pleasant to walk... A beautiful building situated in a well maintend Park. The museum is'nt really that impressive but its O.K. for a brief glimpse. A nice and serene area for a little stroll away from Punes daily noise and dust.

Good for 1 hour visit if you want to relax from Pune. really amazing building...no doubt...but you know what has made me feel proud to visit this place was the fact that Kasturba gandhi, wife of Bapu, gave us a lead on how to support your spouse come may what. She lived here in very testing time... The must see place in Pune . I doubt everyone would be aware that Ghandi's final resting place was in Pune . Excellent exhibits and the grounds are spectacular. Just watch your step when walking down stairs as they are a little run down. Easiest... A glimspe of a great life, tragedy in the midst of solitude...and a location where the Mahatma is bound to have thought out his end game. Aga khan palace is a beautiful house on nagar road. the setting is very pictureque and there is more than a bit of history attached with this place. Mahatma Gandhi along with Ba were the political prisoners here. A well maintained and peaceful place. If you're a foreigner, avoid the museum: it's not worth 100 rupees.

The park (which is free) is instead a small nice retreat from the city, which is just a few dozen meters away. 
The palace itself can't be visited - except the museum part... This is Great peice of History where Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned. and has a memorial (Samadi) to his beloved wife Kasturba Gandhi..

Following the launch of the Quit India movement in 1942, Gandhiji and his wife Kasturba stayed at the palace for nearly two years between 1942-44.

It was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III, in Pune (1892). It is one of the protected monuments by Archeological Survey of India (ASI).
Gandhi... This overrated overpriced attraction is not worth it! Plus they charge tourists a separate price than the locals!  I call that segregation and robbery! They show nothing just walk past by 2-3 rooms and go back home ... Nothing special that you can see ..The main part of the palace is the 2nd and other floors which are closed for public ... Parking is free and ticket is rs... Nice Place - well it is a Palace. Interesting to find out about MG and his wife's Internment. Worth a visit, if you are around for a while.

Once inside the lush green gardens, the sounds of the highway just fade away. You are able to see the well preserved rooms where Gandhiji and Ba were kept under house arrest. The rooms in Aga Khan Palace try and depict MK Gandhi's time spent there, with model statues and artifacts. However, its poorly put up and maintained.
Lush green huge gardens and a shop selling pickles, jams, etc. An interesting and historically significant site, but typical Indian lack of organization makes it not as well presented as it could be. And someone explain the point behind printing elaborate tickets that you hold onto for about 1 second as you turn from the ticket... Once you enter the gate of Agha Khan Palace, you will wonder whether you are actually in the city. This historical place is so calm, silent and serene that you will feel that you are in another world. If you are a history lover, then... Mahatma Gandhi were kept here for 2 years.

However, it was an interesting diversion on a hot day, and you can while... Good nice place to refresh  India's historical significance. Worth the visit. Clean calm serene atmosphere. Really enjoyed being there. It gave a good history of the place but it was geared more to the Gandhi fan rather than showing it's importance in the Pune area. Still a worth while trip. Ghandi is an all-time great historical figure. I probably spent about an hour here. The only reason I could see for someone to visit  it would be , if someone was very keen of the subject of Gandhiji.

I feel very joyfull and full of positive energy whenever I visit ISKCON. Prasad provided here is very very tasty. however iskcon pune is quite smaller the bangalore nd delhi. By far the best Temple Complex in Pune as compared to many others.  Very well maintained in the own style of ISKCON cult. Has a beautiful Balaji Temple too, and in Main temple, the Krishna-Chaitanya, Krishna-Radha, and Jagannath, Balram and Shubhadra, while a Kaliamarthana Krishna... serene, calm, located on hill top, but it would be becoming a commercial spot soon.

Forget about that let's talk about the temple.
This temple is not big as like the all ISKON temples based in other cities.
If... It's a divine beauty with hell lot of art. One must visit if you love to forget yourself. A very lovely place with lots of preaching. PUNE itself is a beauty (no doubts)!! huge temple and ample space for staying should you wish to book the rooms to stay in. the rooms are quite decently priced and some have a/c's too. temple itself is quite large, with decent food in the canteen too Very well maintained temple of Lord Krishna and Balaji. Amazing environment, small play area for kids, wheel chair with ramps and lift for old people, separate food stalls with various options. Gift shops, bookstalls.  I kind of felt like a franchise establishment. It's worth to... The ISKCON NVCC temple is a great attraction in the city. It's a large temple square with remarkable interior architecture. The spacious temple offers ample time and space for the visiting devotees. We visit the temple quite often and is one of must see attractions for any outstation guests at our place.

Could have been advertised more. This was a big disappointment as it was like a childrens school project rather than a museum. Waste of time and money would never recommend to others.Expected it to be informative but was a total letdown The museum is situated on good location and contains miniature train models and many other miniature models other than railway.It though focuses on Railways and its a good informative museum for the kids.

If you did though, Pataleshwar is not very impressive: small (very small) and very plain, there are just a couple statues and no carvings.

It makes sense to visit it only if you are... This is carved out of a single rock, and feels like a smaller version of the temples on Elephanta Island in Mumbai, or Ellora.

Please read recent reviews and then only go for this place. Very small water park. If you want to waste your money then please visit this park. It is crowded on weekends and virtually becomes a hell hole. Management is non existent- water is dirty and there are only two slides which are fast deteriorating. I hope within 1-2 years... I visited Sentosa water Park on 01st and was highly disappointed with the cleanliness and the way this waterpark was managed... i was struggling to find the tube for sliding ride, there is no proper management so that everyone can enjoy... 
I also saw one... I visited Sentosa water park on 1st May 2019 primarily to give a first water park experience to my small daughters.

Goofle map may show wrong direction once you reach Sentosa Resort. 

They have three pools (2 are for rides and 1 for swimming) and a wave pool.

It’s really great place to spend time with your family. its amazing experience with sentosa water park,we really enjoy our whole day in sentosa water park. they providing all facilities for the customers like costume,locker,food and many more.happy environment of water park premises.

Giving catering to Sentosa was my biggest mistake. 

They charged me extra ordinarily like 990 per person but delivered the food... Worst Experience ever...we had a girl with us and all the bouncers were leaching and making fun. It was a very uncomfortable. Please don't go there. Totally waste of time and money. Irresponsible staff once you paid entry fees no one will talk you respectfully all the staff works like government servant.

Mall is situated in Old Pune (MG Road) and has limited shops. Limited food options except McDonalads. Can be a part of walking tour in the area SGS mall is central to pune city and it is nice place to hand around.it has many brand shops such as westside,pantaloons,bata,mark spensers etc. This one of the best shopping destination from Aundh area. .Many leading brand's shop available here. Its one of happening place in Aundh One of a big and good mall in pune. Consist of good infrastructure with lot of branded stores related to fashion,clothes,electronics,furniture and others.Have a good Security and parking facility. Good mall for a half day visit and to pass the time and for shopping. I went with my friends for food here. Mall is small but good and have good number of shops from well known brands for cloth and food. Parking issue, not great variety of goods, crowded place in evening. In fact difficult to locate it. Did not like much in it. Frequently, I visit this place with family in weedends. Malls has lots to offer, shopping, food stalls, fun for kids etc.
Location is plus point so must visit place. With only two decks this mall is not very big . I went along with my family .Choice of fast food is there along with some small snacks stall .Place is strategic as you can visit some brands availability  in here and this is right... Normally malls attract crowds for uniqueness of its stores or kind of events it host. SGS is located in Aundh where you can get various good restaurants of various cuisine and budget. Stores inside are pretty average. You will also see college students conducting surveys... The mall is very small and seems like an unplanned one to me. Its almost a fish market on weekends. Even the stores there are not organised well. It has a westside, pantaloons, just remember these 2 as major stores there. Its just a small shopping mall near the busy crowded camp area.The mall has few branded stores and a small food court with shops like MC Donalds. Many branded store is located inside the mall such as westside , lifestyle, bodyshop , landmark , sports shop , mochi etc . Food station is also there in ground floor - mc donald , subway , dunkin d etc . Nice mall . What... We visited SGS Mall a couple of months ago. Earlier it was an excellent place to spend time but now it has become somewhat less so. The good eateries have left the mall. For shopping there are a couple of good stores available.

For the... Very ordinary mall. At least 5 years behind other trendy malls in Pune. No good restaurants. Only usual suspects like Pizzahut and McDonalds. One of the spacious mall in Pune, Only branded shops are available, Very vibrant , Planned nicely, Heart of the city This used to be the only mall and that time was big enough, but now with bigger and better places, this can hardly be called a mall anymore.
Still the shops and food joints are there, good enough to kill time and money. But if... This is a small mall but have Pantaloons and Westside here at the entrance which makes it a favourite jointly for the shoppers. Food options like MacD and Pizza hut along with some other options also available. its not good mall,
very few option for shopping and the parking facility is zigzag.
one good thing that you can its parking for doing shopping in M.G road. Situated very close to the railway station and MG road, it is great for shopping and has got nice food courts too. Besides regular shops they also have temporary stalls which have exhibitions during weekends and holidays. This is one of the biggest mall in the heart of City. You can have good shopping experience here. This is also a good place for foodies This exactly isn't a mall. it's a establishment with some shops. Although this is the best place to shop in camp area. I went for shopping in this mall, it has good shops for girls shopping and after the shopping had food, enjoyed it. SGS mall has wide variety of Food Counters . The mall is small in size comparable to the other malls in pune but it is well designed and you will be having more prominent shops like eating , wardrobe and some more . 
Overall decent for a visit and you wont have bad time... Its centrally located in Camp and although small in size houses decent brands which are not too over priced. Options in food include Pizza Hut and MCD along with a small food court (which I personally avoid). Definitely like visit due to some good brands... Not a mall you would like to go to.
Very limited options to shop
Limited options for food.
No theater for watching movies
There is one opposite though - Westend (Single screen) youngistan maal having good location in heart of city fuul of yougster enjoying shopping and having fun The mall is centrally located on Moledina Rd, Camp. It becomes crowed on the weekends . filled with foodies . They will provide you with paid parking which id very difficult in this area. I visited this mall during a festive season and it's a pity good mall.
This is a kinda place to hangout with friends. It's a convenient place to visit when the monsoon sale is on since you have quite a few brands in there and can pick up a good bargain or two.  West side is one place for sure where you can get good deals. Practically every... this is a only mall in Camp/Pune station so always crowded on weekends. Not much shops to shop but you have no option if you are living in these areas. The mall is not very big. Although the shops are good and there is a decent number of eating options, you really cannot hang out here for a long time. It seems crowded and noisy. Crowd is always high in number whenever i visit. Smaller mall compared to others in the city. One can have a visit at this place especially if you are planning to visit MG road and have a good shopping time around it. A good and big mall. A nice place to spend time .
A good place for shopping to. A must visit place for all. This mall is very close to MG Road and hence quite crowded in weekend. The food court is quite large and many variety is there to choose from. good experience as it is more like a little complex then a mall . about 60 shops and 2 floors makes it one of the smallest mall of pune. You can visit dominos,Macd and other popular restaurents here Best place to spend time with friends. In Heart of city.Awesome place to hang ON with friends. I am visiting this resto from last 7 years. Belief me its have amazing night funs and very pleasant environment.
Very spacious and good crowd. I was so stressed due to tremendous and alarming rate of pollution in the extremely congested and horrible areas near this place.So i did not like driving across this area for a while. I parked my car nearby and visited this place. I was pleasantly... It's a nice mall but not very big or spacious. It's good for shopping but you will find limited brands over there. Crowded on weekends. Washrooms are very clean. Overall good place for hangout. If you want to beat the afternnoon heat and have fun. This is the mall. The mall is not very big but its still stunning well lit. There are lots shops in the squarish mall. There are many restaurants. Not comparable to inorbits etc but... The only good point about this mall is the central location and the McDonalds , Pizza Hut and other eatery outlets here. Rest everything is outdated. 
Dorabjee mall opposite to this mall is quite good. SGS is a nice compact and friendly mall with good shops, reasonable food court and a convenient location. Underground parking is also available so that's a plus. It is one of the first Malls in Pune and the location is prime in the Cantonment area. Though it is not a huge mall but essentials are available. The food court also is mediocre and not much variety available. This is by no means a Mall!! This is place with a few stores and a few eating joints. The stores are just crappy... and if you consider eating at McDonalds as an event in your life... then this is the place for you. Enjoy... There's not much to do at SGS mall, except if you're in the area and want to kill some time. A few decent eateries and some shopping perhaps, but all in all, it's a very average mall with the only benefit being the central location. Got a good range of sports stores and a food court. Location is central and good and enough parking space One of the earlier malls in Pune located right next to MG road. It may look small compared to the new malls but has a good good court and shops. MG road is walking distance and so is doorabjis 

Parking is mostly available always and... I like the mall but i feel other mall are btter than this, especially phoenix mall is very big and is really awesome. So if you want variety and more stocks rather visit phoenox mall Yes As my title say SGS Mall is not a typical mall which people use to think.

Westside, Pantaloons,Bombay Dyeing, Bata, Soch,Pizza Hut,MacD are few reputed stores. This place is a small shopping centre with very limited options to buy from. We have shops like Pantaloons, West side, woodland, bodyshop and few others, and of course some eating joints as well. This is definitely not a one stop shop for the entire... SGS is probably one of the smallest malls of pune.It has a few good stores including puma,nike,levis,pantaloons.
Other than that it has a few fast food eateries including Mcdonalds. I personally didn't like the ambience and decor much and also it had a very few... We ,along with our friends,went for shopping  in evening hours of Saturday.We enjoyed the ambience as well as the food inside. Although the neighbourhood maybe prime and vital, this place requires improvement. The parking and other accommodation is below average. When you compare with the other malls in the city, you will find this mall quite average. You can take the pain to travel a few more Kms and visit either Amanora/Seasons. A good place to hangout, shop and eat. Everything under one roof. Its suitable for all age groups, from kids to senior citizens. Hey guys, truth be told this mall was a big hit for a couple of years since it saw light but as newer, better and bigger malls sprung up SGS lost its sheen. Can still be a fair place to move around if one just... A Huge and a great place to visit and spend time in Aundh is SGS Mall.Has a huge underground parking but its chargeble.

Good Food outlets as well. Being centrally located, this mall provides variety entertainment as well as shopping mania. Pune camp area is famous already & all that privilege is shared by this mall . Multi storeyed place with variety of shops for every need of a young boy or girl.... Visited after some time. The place seems to be on the decline. The food court has diminished in a sense and some shops such as Allen Solly have moved away.
Somehow did not feel it was the same as before This mall is one of the oldest mall in Pune, with big brands retail outlets and Mcdonalds and other food chains. centrally located and easily accessible. You can buy whatever you want under one room. for eg. dresses, shoes, perfumes, makeup etc. etc. and it is quite a reasonable mall then other malls in the town.  Good music and fun games for children and elders This has been the first mall of pune. Though small it is located in the Camp Area of Pune. Good brands have established themselves here. With eateires like Mcdonald, pizza hut and others too. Good parking area. This is one of the places which I always love to visit.Very small mall, but you can find good brands individual stores to shop.

This mall is ok types with not much option to shop. There are very limited branded shops and no movie theater in this mall This Mall has seen it all.

I have visited this mall for the pizza hut cafe which is there inside the mall. I love the pizza from this place. This is a very good mall. Actually we first visited this place just to park car as we wanted to visit Marzorin which is nearby and didn't get parking space there. While back, we decided to visit the mall and it was really awesome !... SGS is located on MG road. Centrally located. Average options for branded shopping. We use the Mall parking to park our cat and do shopping in other shops on MG road n East street 😉. The mall fails to impress me each time I make an attempt to be! The architecture as a whole looks bland and doesn't offer much grand feel.  The major retail chains however manage to breathe life into it.  Have often seen much school and college... well its a centrally located mall just near the M.G. road.It is small mall. just I think two floors is there.but it is nicely maintained. good cleanliness and also food court is good. lots of small shops where you can find from pizza, pasta and...

A gud place for shopping...
Ice cream parlourss..... A small mall, but has a very good collection of clothes. A good shopping destination if want to purchase some clothes. Near to clover center as well ( a shopping destination in Pune) After being to huge malls like Rcity & Phoenix, this ones a baby.

However, its located off MG road, thats its USP. Food court is decent. Didnt find much to shop here. As the malls of Pune go, this is nothing special. it has a westside, marks and Spencer's and pantaloons. Overall though doesn't have that much to offer. Maybe a rainy day place but if in Pune for a limited amount of time I would give... Best  location on MG road to park and roam around.

One of the best features is that there is a good central sitting area with visibility to all outlets on a floor. It is not a big... There are many malls much better than this one in Pune. It is better to visit those malls than come to this one which offers very less facilities. One among the pioneer malls in the city, is slowly but steady losing its sheen to the new and glitzy entrants. Phoenix and Koregaon park plaza bring in the glamour that this old lady is failing to provide

Having said that, it is a conglomerate... once it was the prime spot. Now due to launch of new malls it is losing its sheen. the only thing it cant loose is the center sitting area with your snack small mall, not too much variety. Pizza Hut, McDonald's, Pepe London and a few other random stores. Waste of time for me. Small mall very near to MG Road. Very limited brands with small parking space. WESTside is the biggest store here. It is too small. Dirty .  Not maintained. Crowded. No good   facilities   entertainment. U can not spend an hr also in this mall.
