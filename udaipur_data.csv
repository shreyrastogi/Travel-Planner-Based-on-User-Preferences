A must when visiting Udaipur.  This palace is a marvel and so beautiful.  India really is a wondrous land with magnificent buildings even more awe inspiring when one considers how long ago they were constructed This museum provides you with a very good understanding of the place of the Mewar dynasty in Rajasthani history, with lots of interesting exhibits. The building also affords great views of other parts of the city. The City palace is located on banks of Lake Pichola with an entrance of Rs.350/person. There is a crystal gallery with entrance of 700/person. The tickets i found them to be pricey as the property is Trust controlled and also maintained well. There is no... The City Palace museum is very big and time-consuming. If you are spending money on this museum, you must have 3-4 hours to actually visit this museum.

Tickets are available just outside and one should take care of the timings... The entire museum is bustled with a lot of artifacts and royal arts that one can spend an entire day her... overall...

The guides help you navigate through the maze, provide historical perspective, share anecdotes and folklore and even identify great photo ops. Best of all, there... It was great experience to visit city palace with guide. Our guide Mr Om Prakash Rathod was really very knowledgeable person. He made our trip memorable. If you are thinking to go there, kindly search to Mr Om Prakash Rathod. With little ventilation and too much walking, we were super tired walking in the City palace and museum. It did not provide a lot of history and is quite a sad museum. Paintings, weapons seem more new than hundreds of years old - so there...

There are ample information points along the way - save your money and take in the scale of this magnificent building. Mesmerizing experience to see the palace.  Every nook and corner worth the sight..The horses in the stables looked right royal and well cared for..  The washrooms were sparkling clean and drinking water was available and ample seating provided for weary tourists...Very worth the visit By good behaviour and knowledge of city palace in local tour guide he was proper guide for city palace history Beautiful palace, our tour guide made it even more interesting by sharing significance of each and every thing. Looks great from outside but the inside rooms are small and stairways narrow (that is how they made it back then), and too many people in the museum. Excellent collection of luxury in entire Rajasthan. Crystal room is must to have a visit. The chandeliers are massive and great. The museum could be nice,  but it is so crowded and noisy that nothing can really be appreciated.  It's a palace ok,  but nothing incredible anyway.  It is more stressful then anything.  I won't recommended. One can see the royal days  through the artifacts at the museum. But one must spend at least three hours and more at the museum. A suggestion is that they could sell ticket on the hourly basis. As one gets exhausted and has to leave... its a very huge palace, hire a guide and follow him to know compete history of the palace. its a historical place with proper maintenance. if you have money you can book a dinner at the palace. please check online prior for booking a dinner...

You can skip the Crystal Gallary but its very Imp to visit the City Palace Museum and take the Boat ride here. History beckons the visitor here. The palace is simply mind boggling. The museum is kept well in good condition. The life of the Kings used to be full of opulence. Wonder whether the subjects were also leading a good life during those times.... if you visiting Udaipur this the a must visit place to see.
well maintained palace and alot to see inside the palace. The museum situated with the City Palace is quite nice and one must visit. Check the timings before going. However the light and sound show is not very great. The objects inside the museum are great but  the museum itself is in a very dilapidated condition. I wish someone in the government would take the time to restore the museum. However what can one expect from the Government! ( tickets super cheap!!) A palace turned museum. Definitely worth a visit while you're here. A lot of varied and interesting displays inside. One of beautiful museum in City Palace, Udaipur. Efforts are made to exhibit and save our rich culture for next generations So much of history and beauty.  You can hire a guide but if you want to roam around at your own pace rather than being dragged from one point to another, try the audio tour which you can do at your convenience.

I love Udaipur and go there as often as I can manage.  I recommend it as a most interesting destination in Rajasthan. This is an average city palace compared to palaces in other cities of Rajasthan.

A must visit to know the glory of the Rajputs. Has interesting aspects to discover if accompanied by a good guide Very good historic location if you are into castle and all. You have to take guided tour. Take care of kids. You enter via a huge courtyard. And through several gates.

Good museum worth visiting once. Will take around 1 hour. Involves lot of walking and climbing stairs. It's rich in heritage and provides an aesthetic review of the Rajputana empire.

This was one of the best organized Palace/Museum excursions. Beautifully maintained. Guided tours extremely useful - no touts or fleecing. Delightful! Take a guide when u r going there and take help of the hotel or hotel cab drivers. The cost of the Guide for the whole palace visit is Rs.350/- only. This was very enjoyable and it was a lovely piece of history. The rooms were all very nicely decorated.

Otherwise it looks same like other museum.  This place is very nice and full of knowledge...

Arms, armour, silver, jewels, carvings, uniforms, fabrics, portraits - all the usual trappings of a museum but with the exotic twist of India. Its good museum situated in the city palace. One should spare at least one or two hrs to see this museum I liked the city palace a lot.

the museum, connects to the hotel and office buildings and the palace is still used by Indian Royalty Amazing place but also needs some restoration of this museum although this place sincerely needs more lighting. Best part is the history behind this beautiful palace.The way guides explains you is little comical yet helpful.

Well documented history along with exhibits of the various dynasties that ruled the region in the past. Various armaments also displayed there. Good place to acquaint oneself with regional history and the lifestyle of that period. The Museum is huge, never ending, beautiful, yes you can get lost if you don't follow the numbers. We enjoyed the experience. The many rooms in the palace / museum have tiny, narrow hallways and lots of up and down stairs. Most (rather empty) rooms in the museum were not that spectacular nor contained anything particularly interesting but worth the visit. Nothing much interesting inside this Government museum located inside the City Palace. its very cheap in terms of tickets, but have not enough interesting things inside it to watch. This is the best way for witnessing the grand heritage of Mewar lineage. The grandeur of this magnificent place just dazzles one. Must visit !! This places takes you back in time to another world - a world of maharajas and wars and special things. Good collection of artefacts and different unique exhibits.

U can see all antiques & old King & queens clothings & armours.  Must Visit. The museum is so big and yet one does not get tired. There is so much to see and so much to cherish. The Glory of Indian heritage, art and culture makes one patriotic once again. I have visited once earlier but now I have visited with family. I enjoyed the old historical palace.

I've been in Udaipur two times in my life and every time I've been in this palace A must visit when in Udaipur.

Entry fee applicable for cameras as well. Visiting city palace will tell the lifestyle of... The magnificent look, paintings the wall and the history explained by the guide. The armors of the kings and the pictures on the wall that explained the historic events are so real. The private rooms of the king and queens are just wonderful.

Located within the Palace we felt the museum helped us imagine life within the Palace. The displays were well maintained and presented. Used the audio guide in the palace and I think that is what makes it nice. However I think that it is very pricey altogether - 450 rupees in total with the audio guide. 

The palace has a nice history behind it, ornate architecture and... A good and clean place. Well maintained, Full of History from the period of the Great grand father of Pratap till date... Ancient Weapons, Beautifully decorated glass rooms, Beautiful paintings, Sculptures, Ancient used musical instruments and lots more. Do visit the behind are of the... Lots to see and tonnes of people to navigate through! Well kept and well maintained. The guards were super helpful. They have an app too but I didn't find it very useful! it is museum well maintained , a place to see traditional things , it is part of the city palace , worth giving a quick round after seeing the palace. The palace looks better from the outside than from the inside. Overpriced, comprare to India prices. It is a nice place to spend a couple of hours in a hot afternoon. Spend a good 2 hours at the place. The title of my review says it all. 

Quite a mediocre experience was my visit, with not much of substance. we were lucky to see wedding preparations as it was wedding season. Someone had paid for thousands of marigold heads abs a thousand oil lamps and they were making them ready for the evening.
Our guide was good and we learnt much about the palace,... A must view palace for those who like to be close to history. It has a view of the whole Udaipur city and also the lake palace. It has an osm shopping lane on its way where you will find leather bags, diaries, jewelry, clothes,... I liked the amience. However, I found  the tickets were bit expence. I took the audio tour and paid 230 rupees for it. I wish I could have opted for a actual guid it would have been better. But overall it was an amzing experience Really just another palace and definitely not the nicest in Rajasthan but it's worth a trip if you have free time in Udaipur. I just wouldn't stay long enough to hear the entire audio guide. The outside is really nice from a boat ride -... It was well maintained overall, but not scrupulously clean. Perhaps due to functions held there. Historical artefacts and displays were interesting The whole tour of the Museum is well managed, guides are organised. The place is well maintained courtesy of the HRH group of hotels. What lends to the aura is the presence of the HRH Arvind Singhji Mewar in the adjoining palace. Some incredible facts... Its a nicely kept museum.Takes you into history.Artfact are properly maintained and there are directions given properly to guide you your way. The view of Udaipur city is awesum Do not waste your time in the Museum you get better options to eat, roam and explore then just going inside in a tightened and congusted Museum packed with crowd and people stepping on your feet and falling on you to get there pictures clicked. Apart from scenic beauty, and some steep stairs, not really worth the time. But if you want good pictures and something to do, this could be a good 2 hours stop including the exterior too! try the boating if you can. This was a great visit.  Learnt a lot about the Jaipur Rajahs and their ways.  Great collection of weapons, fabrics, etc. The Museum is good but nothing extraordinary. It is huge but always crowded. There are better museums all over India. Nevertheless, it's a huge tourist attraction. Very good place to visit while you are in udaipur its historical place and must visit with family you got some good stuff there This forms the core of your trip at Udaipur. Be prepared to dazzle yourself with different facets of life of Maharajas. The palace is very well maintained and can easily boast of among the best maintained places in India. This museum is a must for all those who go to the Palace . The collection of the royals of the Udaipur and articles which are on display are worth your time . A must for anyone halo is not in a hurry or has... Palace is done up really well. It is not like forts of Jaipur where you just have to walk walk and walk. Here every section provides you with different sort of amazing experience! awesome museum ...... no match ..... awesome thing in udaipur...... still Raja of udaipur handle the fort.... all the heritage things are nice maintained...... Being a true Rajasthani, I am big admirer of Royal life and always ready to visit forts and palaces.   I really enjoyed seeing the well preserved lifestyle of maharajas who served India for a considerable time. There is a lot to see in city palace.... The palace is quite commercialised and there was nothing much to see as most of the palace was closed for visitors. It was definitely not worth INR 250. A real historical place of Udaipur which was built over period of some 400 years being contributed by several kings of the dynasty.

A great museum dedicated to Ranas of Udaipur and their kingdom. Very nice place but not good for old people as you need to walk through narrow corridors and steep staircases. Closes by 5:30 Pm and takes more then an hour. Always have the guide alongside unless it becomes silent story! It is a collection of the various things used by the Maharaja's of the Mewar empire and show cases their life styles and their lives at large. A journey to the bygone era. reasonbly well maintained and must visit to anyone visiting udaipur.

The collection of paintings and antique weapons is unique.  Glorious opulence! Can be made into a nice place but as it is part of city palace looks small and not clean at all. Should be avoided as such. Staff was also not Sarkari types City palace is beautiful place, its good to be there with family. several things of Maharan Pratap are kept there for example weapons, guns, dress, etc. An excellent place for history lovers... You relive the legacy of the great mewad rules and relate to their life style.. their valour and royalty. i m very fond of history and the articles placed in museum makes me the feel that i was in the ancestors tym .. worth visit A Must see if u are in Udaipur not only it gives an incite to the great history of rajputans it is just got amazing view of lake  and love taj palace hotel in it.
what is important to enjoy the place  is that you... Loaded with artefacts...painatings...arms...symbols ...rich with history and heritage...lots of stuff to see...well maintained...
but people not that interested in history might find it bit boring...

All in all a ok place. Spare the time to ""stop and smell the flowers"" and not rush through the place like so many rushing by you. There is tons to see and never enough time to take it all in! The City Palace Museum is the jewel in the crown of the Udaipur City. It is here that we came to know the history of the Kings of Mewar, and really get a feel of their culture and their royal life.

It is the oldest... must visit place while in udaipur.good collection of antiques.management is extremely poor.parking is horrible.building is very poorly maintained. I would recommend to visit and spend not much time I would say maximum 1-2 hours just to understand Maharanana Pratap History however its good experience.This Citi palace is near to lake so View is also amazing. The various types of Guns (two in one, three in one) Swords, Bhalas etc. The experience is not among the best. Spent many happy hours wandering around. Great spot full of interesting history and views. Kept me interested and a wide range of things to see. Good escape from the sun in places and cool places to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. The museum is bery large, but the fee is pretty hefty when compared to other tourists spots. In peak season very crowdy. Must be nice in an off season to go here. You can experience the history here. Always go with a good otherwise you will not get the inside of it. A beautiful Museum in the heart of the Udaipur city. Very well maintained. But was very crowded due to Sunday. History of Maharanas depicted nicely in various section of the palace. Nothing great to see except the Maharana Pratap collection and the Silver gallery. The toiltes are very dirty. Good place to goto with a guide to see the historical advances that the kings made.

Lot of well maintained stuffs to see. It will take 2-3 hours to visit every corner of the fort. The experience is amazing and brings you face to face with the period of the rich Rajput Royal heritage. Rich images, colorful belgian glass based pictures provide an amazing view. At the Museum one can see many ancient Rituals of the Mewar Gharana..
Living Style
Weapons
Ornaments

Some great photos and a good collection of clothing to be seen. The ease of access to this museum is the first pleasure to experience at this site.

I have been to many forts and city palace is one of the bigger fort i have seen.It was very hot during the day in October and that ruined our experience. the entrance... Visisted city palace in month of October.  Its quite hot and humid during first half of October.  The palace is huge and entry ticket for musium is expensive.  Its avarage place.  One could have great panaroma view of the lake and udaipur city. Disclaimer: we went when tourists (incl us) had overrun the city walls!

The strangest contrast was the magnificent fort walls, the sprawling lake in the front, the big grounds - versus - the narrow, small, claustrophobic inner quarters, rooms, ""royal spaces"" and sparse exhibits.

The... Frankly, it isn't worth it. It is good for only those who like to see royalty and how they used to live. There is very little museum articles in side. Moreover the ticket charges are steep and previous little to see. Nothing to write home... We went in the middle of the day and it was crowded with large tour groups.
It is great to hear the history and see the additions to the palace through the ages.
You can not rush through so leave a couple of hours.
We... This museum is the only cheap and withing budget palace in udaipur. entrance charges are 115 rupees but if you want to carry a camera they will charge you 255 rupees more so you need to check your pockets.. Overall a nice place Historic collection but very poorly maintained..it was fascinating to go through the ups and downs and narrow passages and staircases of the inner palace, beautiful glass and mirror work on walls and lovely architecture.. Been to palaces that way better maintained.Shambolic and almost in ruins.Is rustic ,doesn't give feel of a palace .Tippu Sultan's palace is way better .Entry fee too very expensive .

A very good place and one of the most important place to visit in Udaipur and City Palace. Without this you can only see the architectural part and not the entire part.

Good to spend some time and observe these to get to know our cultural heritage and more about the land of the mewars. We didnt feel so great about it.. It was ok ..

The city palace museum is located within the city palace complex and it has a huge collection of artefacts and paintings and armoury. One should keep ample of time to enjoy the place. the palace is magnificent with plenty of exhibits, a must see in udaipur.i dont think u must pay much to see the crytal collection b coz veiwing the entire palace is tiresome. City place very gud palace Mr. Arvind Singh ji  maharajah there HRH hotel also there near lake very gud  seen Very well maintained palace and museum. Has most of the historic collections with all the stories that can infuse high levels patriotism the moment you enter in. Brilliant views of the city/ Lake Pichola from the towers of the palace.

Negatives: Slightly Overpriced. Shops inside... very well maintained this palace has a  museum with all usual  weapons & arms, royal dresses, old photographs and portraits and many other usual stuff. ..  The icing on the cake is the collection of vintage cars all in running condition. Worth watching: Unique heritage, historical significance, culture-laden stories.
Disappointments: Expensive entry fee, camera tickets etc. many palace sections are unmaintained.

Overall experience - average..it is just another castle turned museum You will get all the souvenirs you need to buy for your friends and relatives.They have a great variety of t shirts,books, silk scarfs  and artifacts. had been there with my family. go there to know about birth of udaipur.... culture of royal family of udaipur and Mewar....When going to museum, hire a guide or you will just visit the place and wont get to know anything...
pls note that there... A beautifully maintained museum. Take a guide, who would bring out the great history of the Maharanas of the longest serving dynasty of India-the Mewar Dynasty. A must see is the renovated glass paintings and facades towards the end of the tour. Visited as an optional extra to the palace tour alone. Interesting and not overpriced. Shops 5 minutes away - well priced items- very pleasant things on sale - ideal as gifts and didn't get pestered. If you are in the land of Maharanas, you ought to visit their magnificent palace and see how they lived and what they used. This place is too grand and will surely leave you spellbound, especially if you are from outside of India all things make you feel proud to be a part of this legacy, the kings armour, their heroic tales and the luxuries that they enjoyed were well deserved indeed. Negative: dirty and not well kept. But the sculptures are one of the best I have seen in India specially the black stone ones. Some ivory pieces are unique and deserve to be exposed on the best European museums. Even though you don't get to see the whole palace as most of it is converted into hotel and residential palace of whatever remains of the royal family. It is still worth a shot, lots of history. Amazing views of Lake Pichola and Udaipur city. You have not to take nay extra ticket (Other then City Palace ticket) to visit it. It's a Part of City Palace. If you have visited museum of any other fort then you will not find any new thing there. 

Their Jewellery Gallery is amazing.... We visited the palace after the prince's wedding and could see the aftermath of the grand celebration that was held here.

The palace is majestic and huge, spread across a vast area. Its a sight to behold. However, in terms of exploration, only a side-wing... There are some good collection of paintings. So, if you are interested in this, pay a visit. But, the palace itself felt too plain and uninspiring as a king's abode. Definitely not worth the huge entrance price.

The toilet facilities are in no way usable.... We spent several hours here and found it well worth the visit. The palace is well kept and has interesting exhibits a must if in Udaipur Must visit place for museum lovers. provides you with great view and history artifacts. Also make sure that you have a guide here which will cost you Rs 200 or so. The museum hosts a lot of great items! some gems even!
We found the museum a bit messy and composed of too many rooms looking exactly like the next one...
The walls and some paintings are damaged by people ""touching"" or just hanging out against... its got some really unusual exhibits ...and worth a proper, long visit so as to see everything properly.
its very well-kept and clean.
but the place needs proper guides.
many exhibits need better explanations and more details, so we can understand the background better It is impressive. Mainly when seen from outside. The whole City Palace complex is awesome. Ticket cost is fair but it is necessary to pay an extra to be allowed to take photos inside. There is an internal patio which with ASTONISHING vitrals which has... Definitely worth a visit. Large collection of paintings. Awesome silverware- even buggies. Give yourself enough time- at least 3 to 4 hours to see everything at leisure. It was fun to see the palace and know the history, We really liked it. Great views and in fact you can see the whole Udaipur. Plus a lot of things preserved from the History. Overall good Nothing really special about it.. 
To be a paid place, its not in a good condition, and the are no comments in the walls indicating anything, so you end up just seeing and waling the house if you have been to nicer palaces in India, you may want to avoid this place for the sheer number of visitors it draws. The property is huge and will take anywhere between 4-6 hours to see it all. There are govt guides available for... We visited this during August, its worth visiting the lake , museum. The price is over rated should have been less. also the security should behave with the visitors politely and should have proper managing the crowd. 

if you have time you can visit, A small museum within the city palace complex, not too expensive to get in, a few interesting sculptures. OK but not a must see. Very few remarkable artworks on display and impossible to move around without a guide . I expected much more Thus palace and museum aims to showcase the grandeur and heritage of Royal Rajasthan and Eternal Mewar but frankly, it feel far short of such grand brand names. 

The whole palace, inside and outside, needs a coat of paint. Several cracked glass cases are held... The city palace museum housed inside the city palace is nice as it gives you a picture of how the royalty lived and what were the things they used.

The Silver ware is worth seeing and also some of the artifacts. 

The armoury and the... The arms and ammunitions, designer dresses, kitchenware, silver museum, musical place, horse-ridden chariots.....takes one back to the history.
Rtn.J.Ganesh All is good here only if you have ample time to spent otherwise you wont be able to explore this palace. This is a small, sad museum attached to the much more impressive City Palace. One advantage of a visit is that there are good views to be had of the Lake Palace Hotel from out of the window. The collection itself is nothing special and... Nice place to see how the royal families spent tonnes of money on luxuries. The museum gives details of the family, crockery and dinings used. You can find out a lot about the history of Udaipur and how the Maharanas lived.  The crystal room is also worth visiting.  there is not much to do in Udaipur so this is worth a trip. Very impressive especially the details. Keep an open eye for the small daily details such as bathrooms, bed chambers etc. Try to find connections to the last Raja (handicapped) and imagine him having ALONE  his dinners…. This museum is a must & houses a remarkable collection of ancient sculptures, curios antiques & inscriptions of the bygone era. Portraits & wall-paintings with each room beautifully decorated. Former residence of the late maharaja and maharani (and their predecessors), now a public museum, provides a fascinating glimpse into the pomp and super-luxurious lifestyle of Indian royalty during its heyday.  A well-designed self-guided tour path enables one to visit most of the palace without... Most interesting was the display of crystal from the end of the 19th century. It had been ordered from England, but the death of the current ruler just as it arrived, caused it to be left packaged and forgotten till a decade or so ago.... very good palace one of the best i have seen in india .... great architecture ... good view from the palace of the famous lake pichola... two heritage hotels are there in the palace ... crystal art gallery in the palace is worth watching.... Fascinating place, I suppose like all the other palaces we visited. The wealth of the people who created this must have been huge, and was perpetuated over such a long period of time. We went round with a private guide, who tried to point out... what a incredible palace. the views are breathtaking and the palace has great displays with explanations. we didn't take the guided tours- but we took the audio deal which is good.",24.5764662,73.6835836

I especially loved the view from my room - I could spend hours sitting at the window and looking over Lake Pichola. Very friendly staff too and a spectacular breakfast backdrop at the restaurant Sunset Terrace. Fateh Prakash Palace is a hotel. It is part of a palace complex comprising the City Palace, Fateh Prakash Palace and Shiv Nivas Palace, all linked together.
The best view of this palace is from a boat on the lake. worth a brief visit to see the crystal and museum but I may be confusing Fateh Prakash Palace with City Palace!  You can get a boat to tour the lake from here too Do have a guide or it is like any other Palace. Certain interesting history and collection. Worth a visit. Its expensive at Rs 550 per person. Well maintained and lot to see. The view of the lake from the restaurant, where they serve drink, is fabulous. The palace is adjoined to Fateh Prakash Hotel. Before planning trip to the palace one must check up timing for the same. As is closes in the evening. Palace is worth seeing as it covers a lot on Maharana Pratap You should preferably visit on a weekday.... weekends get very crowded with tourists and locals. A part of the palace has been converted into a museum and a separate section is the King's residence. It is better to take a guide with you as there... I can't go inside but I have seen this from road side. I have been told that it is in the middle of the lake and I dint find it exciting so i have taken the road side view of it.

The food was not something that you would cherish the place for as I have been... Had buffet lunch on a december afternoon, amazing food. Service was fine, taste was excellent.

We had their continental  breakfast which was just brilliant and the took a stroll around the palace.  Just beware of the ticket you purchase as it make not cover all the areas.  The architecture is well maintained and... The views from the palace are grand, its perched on the highest point in Udaipur. A guide informed us that its also the highest palace in Rajasthan. But, there is too much maintenance of the place, some parts look freshly plastered and painted. The Fateh Prakash Palace is a part of the expansive and royal City Palace complex! 

A lovely Hotel overlooking the Pichola Lake :) My sunglasses went missing from the hotel and all the hotel staff could do was a big nothing. 

I was not a hotel guest, after the crystal gallery exhibit we came down to have food while enjoying the taj lake palace view from the hotels... The crystal gallery cost 550 ... Which looks too costly compared to what u get....atleast 2 muesum should be added more....audio guide is good but nothing in hindi... Guess rajasthan caters only to foreigners.... Atitude of all tourism related people is bad towards indian tourist.... MAny Palces Color is not up to the mark. building require maintenance.view is nice as its located at PICHOLA LAKE. Must try the speed boats which take you for a ride in the lake. Also must dos are the camel & horse rides along the lake. You can spend hours sitting by the lake side in the evenings! First of all would like warn you that it is quite a walk to go around and see all around inside the palace, atleast over an hour. But for the walk and climbs in narrow corridors, is a nice place loaded with lot of typical... Wandered around the outside and then paid up to go inside the Crystal Gallery and see the Durbar Hall.

First time we aimed for afternoon tea only to find out this was the odd combination of a toasted cheese, tomato and cucumber sandwich, chips and cookies!! I'm glad we stayed though because happy hour is half price drinks,... The area is under renovation. We saw the renovated rooms which were just amazing. the rooms are not that big but royal. they have windows opeing towards lake pichola with a view of Lake palace. The banquet is just super royal , no match. Well, the place is really nice, expecially at sunset. But I am unsure about recommending it: first of all, it's just a hotel. Second, the entry ticket is crazy. Third, the drinks prices at the hotel bar are even crazier. Maybe a view from the... Spectacular palace with a real live maharaja.  Great crystal collection and views of the lake.  Cheap tickets so not to be missed. This was one of the most expensive ticket entrances we paid in the whole of Rajastan and from what I could tell it was just the Royal Family's old trinkets put on display! not very impressed.

the only positive i would say is have a... Cystals specially crafted for the royal family of a bygone era make an interesting experience. The tour of the palace from inside reflects the riches & styles of the mewar royals. This is not really a site for visitors as it is a hotel although you can view the gardens.  Also you have to buy another ticket to enter the grounds and access to the boat jetty, entry is not included in Palace ticket.  You can... The beauty of the palace - awesome 
Again the history of the past is very interesting!

i went their for a lunch on my city palace visit with some colleagues. ambiance was good. food was ok. price was bit high due to it's royalties. White marble interiors that lead to quite courtyards.  The rooms have views of Lake Piccolo and the Lake palace.

You'll get to see other Jain temples elsewhere This temple was the backdrop for the Octopuzzy rickshaw chase, the guy at the temple was the cyclist in the film! But the temple stands up on it's own as a lovely place to listen to the music. When you visit, make sure you walk... Pop in at 10am for morning devotions-  atmospheric temple So nice to see both men and women sitting together, playing the tabla, singing, dancing and being happy in a ""temple""!

Its a typical Aryan Hindu shrine. Nice carvings, etc etc. this was a very special place we visited every nite around 9pm. after diner we spent at least 1 hr there, immersing ourselves in local culture. the people were very sweet to us and we were well received. beautiful pictures, and statues of the dieties-chanting... Not a spectacular temple, but the evening puja was well worth seeing - wonderful and lively atmosphere. Bit drab during the day. Beautiful engravings along the side of the building. Great to see. We saw beautiful friezes and little monuments devoted to Shiva, Ganesh (the lovely elephant god), Durga.. and even some Kamasutra scenes (hm!). I am not a temple freak so for me it was Just another temple (good looking one though) Stopped here just after sundown after being attracted by singing and drums. Sat down with the locals and joined in with the celebration that happen here every night. Wonderful experience and was made to feel very welcome. This is a nice krishna temple.My mother in law struggled a little with the many steps else it was a nice  visit. Having seen the enormous and magnificent temples of South India particularly Tamil Nadu, Jagdish temple is not impressive from archituctural point of view. It is a small marble temple situated about 50 feet above ground level, just near the main gate of the city palace.... must visit to see the art on marble If you can get past all the people wanting something off you it is nice to see.

We were also lucky enough to be present during... we wandered past this temple while waiting for the palace to open. it was quite nice to go and walk around it (remember to go clockwards, better luck we were told), although one gentleman kept talking to us about going overseas soon because he has... Centrally located, active temple.  Reached by a series of steep steps. This temple is next to City Palace.    The temple construction is marvelous.   I loved the Aryan architecture.   We had the darshan of Lord Vishnu.   The temple comprised of carved pillars and decorated ceilings. The steep steps to the temple is something not seen anywhere else till date. Its a really nice temple which has a lot of stairs but when you reach the temple its one of its kind, Its a Vishnu Temple so remember to take off  your shoes and near jagdish mandir there are lots of small  restaurants and shops... Leave your shoes just inside the entrance at the top of the steep flight of steps - but remember where you left them and don't tip the 'minder' more than a few Rupees!

Walk around the temple in a clockwise direction and bring some small... Well worth a visit. In the heart of the city, this is a focal point of religious like. We intended only to spend an hour or so at the temple but ended up staying for about 2 hours and were spell bound by a ceremony... We went during the morning arti and people were singing and playing instruments.The atmosphere was peaceful. As we went round the temple, we could see the brilliant architecture. Absolutely great! Don't miss, since it's one of the few places that you don't pay for entering... We were there at night and got invited to sit down and participate in a singing ceremony.  Since most of the other temples we visited in Rajastan were not in use, this made our visit here special. nice on the outside, you can see the work is very intricate, but the inside is not as nice, which for a mandir/temple was a little strange.

Worth a quick visit. As temples go in India, this isn't the most interesting but as it is in the center of the old city, everyone visits and you can see all in about 10 minutes. The temple of Jagdish bhagwan a.k.a. Vishnu Bhagwan a.k.a Krishna. 
A piece of great art and architecture in udaipur, a very old temple with great stone arts, a great location for photography. i would like to recommend the temple to every tourist. Didn't know what to expect, but after the Jain Temple in Ranakpur the day before this one lacked charm. Nothing reallyspecial to see there.. The guys asking money for 'taking care' of your shoes should be ignored... I haven't been asked for money for that anywhere else in India either. Next to Udaipur palace, this is a beautiful temple. Excellent carvings and I really liked the place. On your way to palace, you cant miss this. Must place to visit. Will take 10 mins to see. A very pretty temple, at the top of a set of steep stairs, with genuinely very nice architecture and well worth a visit. Raised above the main crossroads north of the City Palce, this is well worth  a stop for a photo opportunity from the outside, if just for the interesting characters loitering on the steps.  Didnt feel the urge though to venture inside. Lovely old temple, very peaceful and quiet.  Having a guide was good to get the history of the place. just like any other temple. You can request the priest to chow you the altar up close. Religious ceremony with people who sing very enjoyable. The temple itself was average, although the walk up the steps for the view was fun.  At the bottom are the ricksha wallahs and nearby are many of the high pressure shopkeepers.  This temple had a small donation. A beautiful temple with carvings on all sides. Real people as well as tourists are here, and you are in the middle of a busy section of town with much to see. The great ancient temple was a treat in the middle of the city Fun to walk so many steps and then visit. Again, it is right in the heart of city so you dont want to miss it. Nothing special but in the middle of city so just drop by, no entrance fee, you can tip the person that keeps your shoes during your visit though...People are really praying there so be respectful. one of the oldest temple of Udaipur. this temple is of lord VISHANU. you will feel peace in your mind while seating inside the temple. the carving on the temple is very good and eye catching. to visit the temple one should cilim the staircase... From the steps of this temple we had an amazing view of the Holi celebrations - everyone so friendly and welcoming.  The Temple itself very interesting - we were there for a puja and made welcome This was a marvelous temple, with great stone/marble carvings, set right in the city centre, and still in very common use by the locals. Loved the temple, the atmosphere, the stone carvings, and the friendliness of the actual faithful frequenting the temple. That's right....James Bond was filmed here in Udaipur and this temple is in the movie.... Underwhelming after the Jain temples at Jaisalmer. however if you haven't yet visited a Jain temple, do go here for a nice introduction - the architecture is lovely Krishna Ji Temple..OK..architecture is nice.. but similar temples are there in Udaipur as well.. We went as its near to our hotel..has more than one enterances..near to city palace..u can visit City Palace intead.. Ocupa lo que podría denominarse el centro de Udaipur pues es lugar de paso; reina impresionante sobre unos cuantos callejones que salen dispersos en varias direcciones. Es un lugar de culto pero animado pues la gente acude de la mañana a la noche, rezan, cantan,... right in town, worth a visit even if your templed out! Pretty big temple and one of the first where we saw some activity. Local people where just doing their ""thing"" which was nice to see. Lot's of stone work and still looking good. Drop by this one if you visit the city palace, as it's... Great art and architecture and an easy opportunity to visit a living, active Vishnu temple.  Nothing but good vibes from locals and priests, no pressure, just watch, poke around, ask questions, whatever you like.  Centrally located contrast to the commercial bustle and crowds of the... Very peaceful and I love the aartis. Quite and old temple and is just on way to city palace. Quite beautiful walk from city palace, visiting the temple, and then walking down towards gangor ghat, the banks of lake Pichola. This was our first hindu temple and what made it fascinating was that it was in very active use- perhaps not the most striking from an architectural viewpoint but an hour of people watching was very worthwhile. Small and ornate temple. Well worth a visit but very crowded. You need good elbows. You visit Jagdish temple just because you are right there after having done City palace, otherwise no big deal. It is good enough to see it from outside. Prepare yourself to go up the stairs.  The roads getting to the temple are narrow and your driver will have to drop you off, so be ready to walk. The carved details on the outside of this little temple are impressive. Still a well visited temple for worship and close the the City Palace. Got connected.

Must visit.

We visited in the evening Aarti time.

It remains open till late in the evening. Approx. 10 pm.

Near City Palace, Bagore Ki Haveli, Lake Pichhola.

Famous and well-known place. A real hands on experience with people worshipping praying and chanting. Soup kitchen operates from the side and it was good to see people receiving food.

We had a wonderful thali lunch, very reasonably priced, in the gorgeous pavilion, right at the lake and with AC. 

It was busy Diwali time so great to have the relative peace on the island. So beautiful. This hotel is situated on Lake Pichola and must visit place. The only thing you need to be prepared for is the pricing. the boat cruise prices are steep but worth it to hang around at Jagmandir garden restaurant watching the lake, sunset sipping a coffee or wine.... 

For a holiday maker, good place to click some amazing photos. 

Highly recommended. The entry to Jag Mandir is through city Palace costing 450/person in the morning and 750/person from afternoon onwards. The boat ride from the adjoining park is at 250/person with no stop at Jag mandir, which is just fine.

Reason why it was a let down for a common person like me:

Giving great views of the city... History says Jagmandir island has been a host to Prince Khurram(later Shahjahan) when he had a dispute with his father, Emperor Jahangir.

Lovely to meander around the gardens and maybe have a snack or lassie as we did, in the hotel courtyard to cool down on a hot day Jag mandir is a jewel of udaipur.

Along the way you’ll get the opportunity to photograph... This is a short boat ride from the City palace, and one of the two islands in the lake. The views and ambiance are very nice. The so-called museum is devoid of anything worth seeing and the restaurant is a rip-off. I had a causal visit here. I must say its a photogenic place. Your pictures comes lively. Food was ok. Place is really really great. Just enjoy your day there with your love one. Went here one evening with a friend. Just across the lake from the palace. Very enjoyable time, food, music, a great atmosphere. And such a fantastic place to witness the sunset. 
Would definitely recommend if you’re in Udaipur. Nice boat ride with the beautiful view of the city palace complex.
Not much to do on the island apart from having a drink at the local caffè,  my lassie was quite expensive and not good though. You can reach this place via Boat to spend your evening. Restaurants are bit expensive but can get quick bites too. I would recommend only if you are planning for a dinner. 
Boats are available in every 30mins. It's a small island in Lake Pichola, not much to see. Popular  destination wedding venue in Udaipur. you can take some nice pictures here. If you have time then I would recommend to visit this place, but if you want to skip you can because this place is very small and nothing much to see

Nothing great except for its location centered in the lake. More enchanting from distance when lit up during night. We went for a Sunset Jagmandir tour on the boat. It is priced at Rs 800 per person. There is no commentary on the boat which gives us some history about surroundings as well as Jagmandir. 
Jagmandir itself is a let down. It is a... Dinner place.

Its a must visit palace in Udaipur. It's altogether a different kind of experience!! I have visited there with my friends. No doubt its a beautiful place. Its an island. But it is very much expensive. One can go there for photography only there is nothing to see there, only restra is there which is very very expensive.

Once at Jag Mandir, you can relax and enjoy the sunset from there, while sipping on a drink with cashews in hand! Absolutely magnificent place to get a good view of Lake pichola. Is very well maintained and a must see if you are in Udaipur. The only way to get there is take a boat ride from the city palace. we saw the Jag Mandir behind the Taj Lake Palace, at night and from a distance it looked very fascinating.

If one is staying... Jag mandir is in the middle of the lake pichola, and well known for marriages of celebrities. Its good place to be there. i had gone to attend the wedding and found it to be the perfect place for memorable wedding location. Where is the temple? Never mind the place is so peaceful, to be ONLY disturbed y noisy and boisterous travellers. I like the restaurant and the ambience around the tranquil island. Plan to stay back some day to enjoy the scenery at night too! The place is suitable for large private private parties after sundown as it has excellent views of the lake and the Place. 
However for a tourist visiting the island during the day its a bit of a letdown. 
The place is shoddy and the restaurant... You have to take a boat tour to get here.  I'd avoid the lake if possible and thus avoid this tourist trap.  Food and drinks are expensive and definitely not worth the stop.
At night when its all the lights are on, it looks like... This is a stop during the boat ride in Lake Picchola (if tickets are purchased from within the city palace compound).

I'm figuring it would be romantic at night though. It's... I think my title is deceptive. The place is deceptive only in terms to its name. It's called Jag Mandir but has no mandir. It is a well decorated restaurant with history. The place has a lot of Mewar history (regional) and allows you to... Was here for a wedding, and my god, this place is royal beyond expression. One of those experiences which is itched in my memory. A boat ride takes you to Jag Mandir. Beautifully built, it doesn't house a temple but instead has some fancy restaurants. The view however, from the middle of the lake, is beautiful. It's built like a chariot being drawn by 8 elephants..splendid. Jag Mandir is very well lit at night. its a 1 hr boat ride from the City Palace. its a  small island  and hosts a restaurant and bar. average experience The boat ride from the City Palace to Jag Mandir was just about average. The view of the lake is better from the shore or from the top of Sajjangarh Palace. Nothing much to write home about Jag Mandir. The place is well maintained, but...

The hotel is totally out of character as the... We went on dinner here and found that this place was overhyped and artificially inflated. The food quality was average and the prices horrendous beyond belief. Besides, there was a steep cover charge to enter the restaurant which is easily exceeded thanks to the hilariously... the boat ride to the Jagmandir transports you to another world. the courteous staff and the beautifully maintained property makes you wish you were born in the era of the kings and queens.

You have number of points there to click tons of photographs, trust me you will be amazed. Then stay there till... Though boat ride is excellent. Jag Mandir is similar to any garden & not worth the money you pay for it What a charming property, if one can afford a dinner must definitely be planned, book in advance during the peak season, i tried the 1st day but was full, so booked in advance for the next day.  The food is ok, but the whole ambiance,... you get the boat tickets to visit this hotel from city palace. This ticket is highly overpriced, till 3.30 PM its about 500 rs per person & after 3.30 PM its about 650 Rs per person. In return what you get is 10 minutes boat... This place is just for serving food to foreigners. There's nothing that you would do. They have same gallery that has few paintings and a hall room (unfinished) that you don't want to see after coming from a boat ride so far. The view of Udaipur City from Jagmandir is awesome. One can go and spend hours there just enjoying the view of lake palace and city place while having some chilled drinks accompanied by some tasty food. Having bear at Jagmandir hotel was great fun. quite and calm place. One can reach there only through boat which starts from City Palace Went to this place with great expectations. We had been pre-warned that the food was not great but that the property was very pretty.

Agree, the property on the lake is stunning with great views.

An experience at the hotel sums it up for me... One of most disheartening trip.  A trip with lot of expectation ended with lot of dissatisfaction. The first shock was the price.

Please take water / snaks with you as if you feel hungry its very expensive restaurant.  The place itself is middle of pichola lake. One can have great view of place from here. Evening ride is much... The boat ride to Jag Mandir is really nice. Jag Mandir in itself may be very nice and beautiful, but other than the numerous restaurants, there's nothing much to do there. Lovely place.  Even great Emperor of Romance ""SHAHJAHAN""  chose this place to be his abode in Exile.  We loved the views and the lovely Cool Breeze n the music by the Jaltarang Player.  It was Romance at its Height.  All the couples were mesmerized young... This place is the most talked about and top of the list in Udaipur sightseeing.

Not that expensive and nice way to relax. Boat will take you to this small island and you can stay... If in UDAIPUR and you missed dining at this place and i think you wasted trip.This as per me is one of the defining places in Udaipur.Boat ride till the place is simply amazing and refreshing we went there for our honeymoon dinner.

This place is much better viewed, when lit in the night, from atop. There is hardly anything to do here, just that it is in the midst of the lake. and now mostly hotel area and place to hold weddings, it has lovely architecture to see and lovely gardens to walk around.  The view back to the City Palace is stunning. The boat ride on Lake Pichola drops you on this island-hotel and picks you up later. Probably a nice setting in the evening. But unfortunately not so much during the hot day time. (The boat rides closed that day by noon due to some wedding... well going to a  JAG Mandir is itself an excitement, going on a boat warm welcome at the gates , a very good property to visit, every tourist should visit it.

You get off at Jag Madir and can stay as long as you like.  It is a very pleasant place to... Grab the boat after visiting the City Palace (at the bottom of the hill towards the water) and check out this spot during sunset.

It’s a beautiful island having very beautiful garden.
Very Good restaurants on island.

We stopped and sat at one of the many tables dotted around the restaurant area. The views back over the lake were lovely and... Nice to walk around this island garden. Some of the garden and structures are abandoned which adds an interesting touch. The boat ride to and from is pleasant, doesn't cost much and would rate ""4"" or very good, and it actually better value than the... Cover charges per couple is Rs.2,700 and single is Rs.1,800.

The island itself is not huge... Take the boat. The cost will surprise you but it is worth it.
The cost is Rs 560 per head post 3 PM. If you take the boat before 3 PM, the cost is lesser. 
You will pay for the camera as well. 

The name... Jagmandir Islans is pretty much a hotel and spa with an overpriced restaurant but the real value is in the photo opportunities and the nice garden to relax in. Jag Mandir Lake palace is built on Jag Mandir  situated on Lake Pichola. It's a popular location for weddings especially the royal families of Udaipur. Sculptured elephants guard the entrance. There's a lovely terrace and garden where you can enjoy a cup of tea. Make... We walked around here as part of our boat ride tour - it was a hop on / hop off type of affair.

Given its location the views are amazing. The gardens, decor, architecture is very beautiful. I didn't eat at the restaurant but the location is excellent. Jag Mandir is the stopover point during the boat cruise of Lake Pichola from City Palace.
Whilst is was pleasant enough, there is nothing special here and, personally, I felt the stopover detracted from the cruise itself. Jag Mandir is a good place to see in udaipur.
It is a part of the boat ride from city palace.
If you visit udaipur and missed this place then you will be in a loss.
There is also a option of SUNSET Boat ride. One of the things to do in Udaipur is to take a boat ride from the City Palace around Lake Pichola.  And one of the stops is the Ghat at Jagmandir, a pleasure Island for the royal family both then and now.  The island is... There is very little to see here and the cafe is expensive. Maybe a nice place to visit for a bit of romance but frankly there are nicer, more interesting places in Udaipur. Nothing to see of do. The restaurant rooftop gives you good views of the lake, the lake palace and the city palace. But its a part of your boat tour of the lake, so you might as well visit the same. Best time to go... Beautifully harmonious, tranquil summer palace with great views of the city and lake palaces. Relaxing bar serving refreshing drinks and good coffee. Easy to while away an hour or so in the shady garden.

The ride is beautiful as seeing Udaipur's skyline from the water gives a different perspective, but Jag Mandir is the highlight. The old palace on the island is set in formal gardens fronted... So after all that lining up and getting to the boat launch and elbowing crowding tourists, the island wasn't that much to see. We visited on December 29, 2013.

Otherwise, You have take a boat ride (INR 500 per person) at city palace to reach... Very disappointed.

It is a lovely palace on an island in the lake and so can be accessed only by boat. It has a good restaurant, gardens and a lovely view of the lake. We enjoyed watching sunset from the palace. The boat ride from the City Palace was expensive for a very short trip, and once there, there is nothing unique or impressive about the mandir or the views relative to other sites in beautiful Udaipur. It is like heaven garden. We liked it very much. I definitely recommend you to see t if you visit Udaipur. Its in the middle of the lake where you can take some snacks and drinks with good view of the lake. You can take good pics from there.

What you will find instead is a palace built between 1551 and 1652 that is now used largely... A nice boat ride from the City Palace takes you to the Jag Mandir, which is a nicely laid out palace on an island in the lake. The gardens are beautiful and there is also a restaurant and bar. What attracted Raveena to Shakira to this place, you'll know once there. The mouth gapes open in awe. Beeeeeaaautttifffful! A trip to the City Palace, Udaipur, can be extended by a boat trip around Lake Pichola and onto Jag Mandir.  This is a pleasant interlude from the hectic streets and markets of Udaipur. 

It is a tourist haven, but a nice place to spend... we visited Jagmandir as part of the boat ride from city palace. Nice quite place, managed well. after a good boat ride, we reached this beautiful place in middle of the lake. Many nice view of the lake Go to the City Palace and pay 25 rupees to enter the complex which contains two beautiful heritage hotels. Then buy a five hundred rupee ticket to the Jag Mandir island.

There was no restriction on the time to be spent here as there were boats every 20 minutes. The high point of Udaipur trip definitely. Jag Mandir was part of the guided tour which we took from the Lake palace. We went there is the evening and were totally impressed.

Jag Mandir is also located inside the lake Pachhola and has beautiful views of the lake. You can hang around... Set on an island in middle of lake, with beautiful architecture, this palace and garden is better than lake palace. A boat trip from city palace will take you there. We visited Jagmandir Island as part of the Lake Pichola boat trip (200 Rupee - Adult and 100 Rupee Children - Dec 2012) and quite enjoyed our stop here, finding this a very enjoyable activity in Udaipur.

After a quick pass of the famous Lake... This place belongs to the Maharaja of Udaipur. I must say it is very well managed. The visit to this place starts with a boat ride in Lake Pichola where you get to see all of Udaipur situated around in a boat. The boat then... Jag Mandir sits in splendid isolation in the middle of the Lake. It is well kept, with manicured gardens and alfresco dining with a great view looking back to the City Palace.

Eating while sitting along the lake gives u a wonderful feeling . Nice place to roam and enjoy . Charm of udaipur lies around lake pichola It's an ok place worth visiting especially if you are taking the boat ride over Lake Pichhola.

An elegant and beautiful temple in close proximity to city palace. It is in a busy area and there is shopping possibilities all around While strolling around the pichola lake I was shocked to see a beautifully and very creatively designed shining building in the lap of  the lake.

The boat ride from the Udaivilas jetty to Jagmandir was amazing.  Words cannot describe the magic in the air as the weather Gods had decided to put a punch in our celebrations.  The breeze was... The boat ride alone to Jag Mandir is fantastic and once you are there the views across the lake are beautiful.  You don’t need a guide and you can see the whole place in under 30minutes. Yes...the Literal translation means the world temple...but again it's a palace of the local royal family who are using it quite well, commercially.
They take tourists whoever buys the boat ride from the city palace premises...which is pricey...but then there is no entry fee or... Go. It is a nice piece of history. We stayed at the Lake Palace and they gave us a personal tour. Worth the visit especially if you are staying at the Lake Palace and/or if you are also going to Agra to see the Taj... feels like in a fairy tale....the building, design, deco, the garden, the lake view just so dreamy...love  love love this place We pretty much just walked around the island and the gardens and enjoyed exploring.

After visiting the City Palace and the city, this was part of our boat ride on the lake. The boat ride was really nice, as it gave so many different views of the city and palaces, especially with the sun setting. 
But why stop here?... Need to take the boat ride to this place but what a beautiful site. Visit just before the sunset to get stunning views at the sunset. The boat ride is a good way to relax with boats leaving every 20 mins. Lunch at Jag Mandir could be tried but must be an expensive affair. Sounds like a temple, but is the place where the Maharana's used to party. Its another monument in Lake Pichhola other than the Lake palace (the Taj). Rented out for private marriages and parties. Its restaurant serves some amazing food. A fabulous boat ride out for dinner to Jag Mandir is definitely soul and senses stirring. The property itself is well maintained and exudes a sense of Royal aura on its visitors. The garden takes the cake though We visited this place after the sunset. The boat ride again was a fun ride. The garden was also beautifully maintained. The property is really beautiful surrounded in the middle of the lake. take the boat ride to jag mandir palace,it is worth it.
Take the ride during sunset
It is magical,the palaces gleam in the evening sun like a fairytale In the middle of Lake Pichola, they'll create a wonderful atmosphere with local music, food and beer :) My husband & I took the boat from city palace to jag mandir and had dinner there. You need to make a reservation for dinner & the cover charge is Rs 2700 per couple ( includes boat ride & food cost). It is a beautiful... Yes folks, that's what it is.  Nice little stop on a lake cruise, good for a coffee, and to see how the rich locals marry off their kids - in style! Its a fun visiting Jag Mandir. First, you enjoy a joy ride of lake pichola. The boat takes a round of lake pichola before stopping by at Jag Mandir. And when you are inside, you get a beautiful view of the City including city palace... This was not our first visit to Udaipur and some places are sure worth re-visiting such as Jag Mandir. 
You can take an official City Palace Boat to the Jagmandir if you want to see to the Jagmandir from outside and visit it from within... We all thought we were going to a temple, since mandir usually temple, but this was a restaurant or something. We ended our wonderful boat ride here and got off, walked around aimlessly for about 20 minutes unsure of the purpose of this place and... We went over by boat from our hotel for dinner. Dinner began with a guided tour of the palace by a friendly guide. Apparantly this palace was the inspiration for the Taj Mahal, although it has lost most of the expensive decoration.
The meal was... Boating on Lake Pichola from the City Palace was a leisure ride till we were ceremoniously dumped on Jag Mandir island. Though the views were beautiful, there is nothing much to do on the mandatory 30 minute wait in a place where even the price... Jag Mandir is an island retreat for the rich and famous. This plays host to a series of princely weddings and is a frightfully expensive place. However, a great experience to get there in a boat and the gardens are also very neat and well...

Its situated in the middle of the lake and the view from any table is just amazing. you can literally say you ought to... The boat ride is great for seeing the city and palaces from another perspective, and the indoor restaurant is super value, and a real treat. This is a brilliant palace located in an island in the middle of lake pichola. One needs to pay around 350 rupees to enter this place by boat which also includes a quick tour of the lake and udaivilas and taj palace hotels in lake... We all got some unique photos from this little venture out on the smooth, reflective waters of the lake. The murals in the royal apartment were some of my favorite from my trip in India for both the colors used and the subject matter- elephants.... easy to get to and beautiful gardens very tranquil after the chaos of Mumbai! lots of lovely carvings and plenty of photo ops, nice coffee shop. We visited Jag Mandir on the boat ride from city palace. The visit was not very relaxing as it seemed as though the entire island was being transformed by an army of workers, into a venue for a large wedding and no one seemed to... Beautiful Palace. Enjoy the view of the majestic City Palace and its reflection on the lake! Good during sunset times. Take a sunset cruise from the City Palace Complex and reach around 4.30 pm so you have enough time to explore the place as well... when you are there then u are at a different dimension of this planet and words shall not justify the true experience of its actual existence... Great for weddings of course, although there are a few small rooms to stay in. There is a small museum showing how the island was conceived and built on over the centuries. There are some really large gardens capable of housing over 1000 guests and... it is not a public tourist location but a hotel. i went their with some guests on an extended city palace tour. they have a good open garden bar with restaurant. peaceful environment. i would recommend the place for business meets. There was a wedding in the evening when I was visiting and the entire staff was busy decorating it but still they attended. The Big Fat Indian Wedding really great place, you have to go thru boat and very well mainited and here Shahjan thought of building Taj Mahal, thought came here after that he built it. good food and servce We have been looking at this temple from a distance and always wondered what will be the experience like if we visit that place. It is bang at the center of this artificial lake Pechola in Udaipur. It was dug out about 150 years back.... the temple is at the entrance to lane going to the museum.it is 200 years old temple. spend 9 lakhs that time. worth a visit. Take the last boat ride to Jag Mandir from the City Palace complex (5pm) for beautiful low-angle light at sunset. The best views of the City Palace are definitely from the water. The most spectacular thing in Udaipur...must visit and must spend some time, especially to feel like royalty It's one of the best venue in the world for wedding or similar functions.
It looks like Beautifull bride when decorated with lights It's beautiful piece of architecture, a white floating palace in the middle of the lake, which is also a hotel and has quite a few restaurants, At the back of the hotel is beautiful garden, over looking the lake and farway hills, where u can... If you visit Udaipur don't miss the boat trip out to Jag Mandir island and palace. Small but well-maintained the palace and its extension serves as a hotel today. This is a good place for a drink or a cup of tea (also some of... Food is not that great but great place to sit and relax. Better than visiting other tired and run down places like he city palace. This sure is worth visiting, before it gets spoilt.
Good boats and tidy place We walked around these gardens for about 30 minutes, we had paid for the inclusive boat ride. The only disappointment again was no audio tour/guide, would love to have spent more time here but we were restricted to our boat leaving times Must take a boat to this beautiful island in the middle of the lake and have a meal there or just a drink. I had my brother's wedding there and it was probably the most beautiful wedding in the family ever. there's hardly any place to visit here. It's simply a marriage garden. The restaurant there is as expensive as any five-star hotel would be. Plus the boat ride to jagmandir costs Rs.300. You can take the similar boat ride at fateh sagar lake at almost... We asked if there is drinking water available?? and the reply was either you buy the bottle (the rates are too high) or drink from the tap water... and than they say we welcome tourists !! :)
The boatman who was taking us back, disappear... I definitely wouldn't make this a major destination, or eat/stay here, but as a brief visit while on a boat tour, it is a nice place to visit and take some pictures. at 2700 per head cover charge my family was excited to dine there, the boat ride was ok, the view and location is very good, the food and service is pathetic. The staff attitude is pain, they treat Indians like beggars. Thats a peaceful small island resort with a garden and a restaurant with limited options on the menu at quiet high rates. They have few suite rooms, which the maharajas got constructed and now are furnished and well maintained and offered at INR 15000/- per...

The most awesome part is the ride upto the jetty & then the view from the boat......amidst the lake it's a b'ful sight & equally enchanting on entrance with b'ful gardens & huge elephant structures. A hot pick for royalish weddings & events. Food too... The island has great potential with the spa and rooms on the grounds.  There is a row magnificent elephants in the front!  The rose garden was devoid of any plants when I was there and they were doing some badly needed painting and upkeep.  The... Had been there to attend a family wedding.

Oh boy! The magical place just swept us off our feet. This place enthralls and enraptures you completely with its eye popping surroundings, architectural wonders, awesome lighting and brilliant food.

A dream wedding destination convincingly. Took the boat ride from City Palace. The Jag Mandir is an amazing place. You can probably spend an hour at the Jag Mandir, if you have more time, there is a Spa on premise that you can take. View of Jagmnadir from the lkae is good but did not find it so attractive after landing there. The only attraction here is - Raveena got married here, shakeera danced here, etc. We took a boat ride to the Jag Mandir as part of the combined ticket at the City Palace (cover City Palace museum, Crystal Gallery, boat ride to Jag Mandir and Vintage car collection). This ticket is well worth and the Crystal collection of Sajjan... Located in the pichola lake this place is a must visit. Just take a ticket from the city palace entrance and you are set for an amazing ride along pichola lake! There are a couple of open restaurants where you can treat yourselves with the... Since we took our boat ride from the City Palace, the boat takes you to Jag mandir and then you can stay there for the desired time and then the palace boat will take you back to the palace. Jag mandir is a beautiful place... Seeing is believing. Small but very attractive.
Garden all around is very common place. Wish it was as enchanting as the buildings around it. Museum inside is namesake only. Boat ride itself is a memorable experience... Excellent place for photography.. Spend some time sitting in the cafe and sip a drink... jagmandir is a beautiful island hotel on the pichola lake. the views from the place are spectacular, specially the sunset and after the sunset the place is lit up beautifully with dark skies in the background. the restaurant is special with carved roof and marble... there really isnt much to see here, maybe it is because i was tired and not in the mood to appreciate beauty but thats just how I felt Complete rip off with terrible non existant service despite the abundance of tourists willing to pay extra to have a drink in the palace. Avoid it. Take the boat ride from City Palace to Jag Mandir. Although the name says Mandir, there is no temple. This is a tiny piece of land located in the midst of the lake Picchola. The area is scenic and well maintained. This is known to... We stopped by the Lake Garden Palace while we were on the boat ride.  It was relaxing and lots of photo opts.  You must go to the top of the terrace to have a good view of the lake and surrounds. The night when we arrived Udaipur we saw the Jag Mandir in beautiful lights, lazer and fire. Not sure what was it about guessed they were probably having some party or wedding. 

The next day we did the typical boat trip at the Pichola Lake... Please avoid the Thali at Jag Mandir Palace Restaurant.. Its exhorbitant at Rs 1099/ + Taxes. And the food was downright bad. They Just serve you Mixed Veg, Chicken ( i couldn't make the difference in the Curry)..Some rice and Rotis.. We had to ask... Jag Mandir is in the middle of lake pichola and is a stop when you take the boat ride from the palace. Mandir is a misnomer here. There is no mandir to speak of but beautiful gardens. You will get bored very quickly. Thankfully a... The boat ride is quite nice, but other than that this place really has nothing to offer. Some nice gardens you're not allowed to sit in, a palace you're not allowed into, and an overpriced, underwhelming restaurant which i'm fairly sure gave me the squits... More then the temple, the market outside is famous. The temple architecture is beautiful with a nice steps which lead you to the temple. It is situated bang on the middle of the road between the buzzing market. It is simply a treat to eyes. A place realy cool and splendid. As it si famous by name Lake City, it lives upto its name. Scenic beauty and parks surrounded by lakes are awesome. Its very nice to relax here enjoying scenery An average mid sized so called palace which is nothing in comparison to the other beautiful palaces of India. Also there is nothing to eat at the canteen for vegetarians. visit if you have nothing else to do Splendid view at night with all the light work however the food at the restaurant was disappointing. Most exciting part is the boat trip to Jagmandir during the night. This is not a temple as it may sound. It is a hotel in the middle of the Lake Pichola. We went there for dinner. We were picked up from our hotel by their private boat. The whole area was beautifully lit up. The dinner... This may disappoint some people as there is not much to see and do once you are out on the island.  A walk around will take 15 minutes and then a drink while you wait for the next boat back (hourly).  But the time went... Was lucky that did not pay Rs. 500 for the evening visit. Visited the place around noon with high hopes but it is a total waste of time. There are much better places in the city who can offer coffee/bar services at a better price.... Great views of the lake coupled with the fact that Shah Jagan took asylum there along with his wife Mumtaz Mahal and son Aurengazeb.

Brilliant view of lake and ford, normal climate, travelling in between the mountains, good for a long drive it was ok ok.. only monkeys are there no other animal. some deer too ( not visible) i feel july is the best time to visit. i stayed in club mahindra holidays resort. it was good. me and my wife went around august last year.the weather is perfect with cloudy skies and not a hint of heat as in rest of rajasthan.before coming here i never knew we have the second longest fort in india after great wall of china.i was...

The sanctuary is not at all worth spending Rs.2500. Its quite hilly, and you cannot sight any animals on hilly path. We saw an eagle and 2 owl nests!!! Its better that you go on drive in the night towards Club mahindra resort. There is... Very rough road. Scenery is beautiful. Saw some birds but no wildlife. Entire tour takes about two hours. Not worth it. Spend your time instead investigating the nearby fort. It is amazing!! The wildlife was very disappointing at the Kumbhalgarh sanctuary. The only saving grace to it was the experience in going in the forest on a rickety drive. You can sight a lot of birds and some kinds of monkeys. An early morning trip is advisable. Though the wildlife is disappointing, it makes up in terms of the fact that you can trek through the jungle with a guide and can see a lot of varieties birds. The guide told us that they were in the process of adding wildlife from... We stayed at Club Mahindra Kumbhalghar with my family. With two kids along Jungle Safari was very much on the agenda.

Lake city mall is newest mall in Udaipur near Ayad river, it has reliance mart and Inox that i liked a lot. This is the mall located on the main road leading to Udaipur airport. Just another mall having branded shops like Reliance,Metro,Mufti etc. Inox cinema is an entertainment source. Fine dining restaurants are available. Lake City Mall one of the two big malls of Udaipur. It can be ranked no 2 because Celebration mall is bigger than this and have more brand and obviously more footfalls but Lakecity Mall has its own advantages. Situated in mid of city Pizza... Rocking mall with good brands to shop n eating out outlets. Neat and clean. Young crowd hanging out. Inox is the cheery on the cake. Park Plaza Hotel opening soon.

Shops here generally offers the consignments which falls und r your budget. It have inox multiplex as well as other shops for shopping such as dressing, cosmetic etc. Parking can be an issue. Lake city mall is at very convenient place and can be reached very easily. It has all shopping brands, a super market, Inox cinemas and food court and all other popular food chains. It has sometimes parking issues but overall its good to go. It is a medium size mall with good shopping options. You can enjoy movies in INOX. Ticket fare in INOX is reasonable.

Also one reliance mart is in the downside of mall good to buy grocery items Its small but has all that a mall owns. There are many shops to shop from. It also has a multiplex so one can go and watch a movie. We stayed in the Hotel, located above this mall & visited the mall twice. Udaipur is still not a Mall culture city so not many outlets were there. But it is well built & had few food options. The last thing you want to do in Udaipur is to visit a nearby mall. Trust me the local city, hotels, and restaurants, and the view of lakes is itself a treat while you are in Udaipur.
Still, when it comes to a movie, you... This is the 2nd mall of Udaipur who touches of ayad river.
Inox cinema is also available in this place & KFC also. OK mall, but nothing special. KFC was OK but little else. Go to the Celebration Mall instead. Much better selection. I usually visit here for Reliance Fresh and INOX. Other than that it has few brands showrooms like pantaloons, UCB, Woodland etc. One can visit for time pass or having some snacks and moody shopping since it is approachable location. Great place to visit and to do shopping. At least i got some good shops where I can find my stuffs and watched movie which was also good. Lake City Mall is centrally located Mall in Udaipur. It has good cinema Hall and some good restaurants & retails stores. The mall is almost vacant. There is only Inox Cinema and few good brands there but almost empty. Nice to spend around hour. Very approachable location in heart of the city udaipur.

The cool breeze when you ride a boat here during rains is amazing..

There are different jetties for different hotels.. Took the boat for Leela Palace from the corresponding jetty Stayed in taj lake palace hotel

From some parts you can see the city palace, which is nice otherwise not the most beautiful part of the city. It's a pond...a drain at most places.

Do cruise it to see the gorgeous hotels and palaces that fringe the lake. Stop over at Jagmandir  for a quick break Its a bit dirty. It looks good only from the Oberoi's. Otherwise its not much to write home about. Yet it seems to be a famous tourist point with the Lake Palace and the Leela also on the same lake Our favorite day of our short visit.

There are plenty of good places to eat and drink around the lake The lake is very big. You can enjoy the lake with the boat ride. You have to spend rs500 each for the boat ride depending upon the time. This was an interesting boat trip, saw the sunset and the lights come on across the city.
Other than that i didn't feel that the trip was overly exceptional.
Probably if you are in Udaipur it may be something that needs to be experienced.
Certainly... I’m not one for boat rides but don’t miss taking the sunset boat ride on the lake. The views are stunning. The sunset was absolutely beautiful. This is the one activity we enjoyed the most. It's abosultely gorgeous, and without doing this your Udaipur visit is incomplete.

Boat ride price is Rs 450 per person for the return... I loved the ghat areas and the lake looks stunning in the night with the city lights and the hotels near the lake are luxurious and there are many lakeside cafes and restaurants where you can sit and enjoy the lake views. I would recommend... It's like the Heart of the city...all the major city landmarks are in the periphery of lake Pichola.

Despite the poor rainfall in recent years, the lake has decent amount of water. One can only wonder how the lake looks when it is full. As is true of any natural water body, there is a cool breeze near the lake, even on sweltering... There are many lovely places to chill around the lake. We were there in June when it's less full. I am sure it's even more lovely after the monsoon. The scenery here is pretty and amazing. Very clean lake. Lots of tourists visit this place. Great experience. Udaipur is a city of Lake. Please visit here in early evening. There are several boat rides 30 seat , 10 seat and 4 seat. These boat provides tour around hotle lake palace. We were very disappointed because water level was very low but it was very very big lake. Boating price was also very high. First India most of the lake appears clean.  However at the two bridges where the lake and city meet  its festooned with litter and general garbage. Pleasant lake with boat rides. Good view nice place to visit . Beautiful place . You see a beautiful lake and can sit on the bank areas can boat . Sad to see people thrown garbage in to such a beautiful lake.hotel owners must help city administration and various citizen groups must come forward to make the lake clean. It's a lake tour - a slow putter around the perimeter of the developed area of the lake.

The scenery is pretty - though as others have pointed out much is in disrepair.

It offers a vantage point you don't get from elsewhere, I suppose.... It's a very beautiful lake, worth visiting twice. Once just before sunset to see the beautiful lake and palaces in and around it.

Prefer going on a non peak day when it will be less crowded else you won’t be able to take good pictures. Also do make sure do boat ride. That’s good. There are two lakes offering boat rides to tourists. One is at fatehsagar lake and other at lake pichola. 

Lake pichola boat ride can be taken from three places. 1) From city palace 2) Lal Ghat and 3) Dudh Talai.  

The charges for taking a... To be fair, it's a lake.  It would be a bit better if it had less rubbish floating in it.
It does have nice scenery around it, but most of it needs some repair.
The sunsets are gorgeous though, worth sitting on the quiet ghats... The boat trip takes about an hour 
It was raining heavy so I decided to pass on it 
It’s worth doing though 
I will keep my ticket until next time Must visit. Try visiting off days or non peak days (like wk days) and u will enjoy as it will be less crowded. A must visit for a perfect evening spending. If you are a007 fan you will recognise this lake and if not you will enjoy the beauty. Both sides are lovely for walking and it is well recommended to take the boat trip at sunset. Lake is impressive if full of rubbish on the banks - this in India after all.
We went to the island and saw the sunset.  Very nice. It was extremely most enjoyably Boat ride i had in this place. Loved the place and the landscape. Love to visit again next year with family. Largest of the 7 lakes in Udaipur.  We can see the lake from many businesses around the lake including the Jagats Niwa Hotel dining area. Located in the heart of the Udaipur city. Lake Pichola is huge and very beautiful. There are a few platforms built at the shores for tourists to witness the beauty of the lake Went for a walk alongside the prominade in evening before sunset. The view is beautiful and especially do visit Ambrai Ghat which is on opposite side of Bagori ki haweli. It is a 5 mins walk from there via the foot over bridge.
Also, there... After a long walk around the city palace in the May heat this was a welcome rest. We enjoyed the boat ride which lasted about an hour and half in total. The boat travels around the floating palace and stops off at a small island... Best time to enjoy the views from the lake is at sunset. Sit at the rear of the boat for the best panoramic views. I highly recommend the sunset boat ride that leaves from Lal Ghat.  Wonderful photo ops and an enjoyable evening on the lake. Go in the fall or winter as the water levels are too low in the spring and pre monsoon season.

The boats two and from Taj Lake leave every 20min and don’t go straight to the Palace... We enjoyed an early evening boat ride around the lake.

There is no way to miss Lake Pichola if you’re in Udaipur. You see it from the City Palace, from the Ambrai Ghat from Udaivilas. You get the point?

The lake host the famous Jag Mandir island Palace in the middle and the only way... It's kind of in the center of Udaipur, and that itself tell that you cant really give it a miss. Though otherwise as well, its a place which do give you a feel of relaxation while in this beautiful city. Must visit! The backside of lake is very congested with limited mobility even for a car.

It is good place Lovely water views and make sure to take a boat ride to enjoy stunning sunset views. Opportunity to take camel rides and get ethnic costume pictures taken on ground area. Lake stinks on the banks, and doesn't seem to be in good shape. The only time we enjoyed being near the lake was night time when we couldn't see the filth in the water. As with most things in Rajasthani cities, it creates a nice view when looked at from afar, but isn't worth getting too close to. Definitely not good for a swim, and probably not to eat fish out of.

It is best to visit with city palace. beautiful view of Taj palace and Jag Mandir famous for royal weddings. boat journey was amazing with kids. water sports  possibilities can also be explore at here. Seeing water in Rajasthan in such large quantities is rare and Udaipur's reputation as the lake city is well deserved.

Lake Pichola is an awesome lake and you must do the boat ride though a little pricy for Indian tourist I preferred the distant view of the lake. Close up, it is polluted.

Boat ride was worth the rs200 if a... Nice backdrop of Aravali Hills. Pleasant boat ride to go around the luxury hotels in converted palaces.  Not crowded like in rest of India.

The Jag mandir and view of Taj Hotel is so magnificent. This is a must do in Udaipur and the reason why Udaipur scores over other cities in Rajasthan. The waters itself are clean and it makes for a nice romantic ride. Perhaps Udaipur is famous more for Pichhola lake than anything else.

Overrated place and nothing great to see here. Palace is just ruins and is badly managed. Tickets are too much and not worth the time. Only saving grace is aerial view of city.  I would recommend this only if you have spare time. Located outside the town, a visit requires atleast two hours to be set aside. Once the top is reached, there is just a derelict building. The only thing worth it, if one prepared to waste the time and effort, is a majestic view.

Visitors should... Old palace on a hilltop, you get off your transport at the bottom and are taken to the top by jeep, great views can highly recommend. It's not worth the visit.

The landscape and the scenic lures you and its nothing more of a magic. Though the palace itself is not highly kept, but its the view which will enchants.... This place is far fetched but good to visit for the panoramic view of the city. Not much to do around there, just see the palace, take some good clicks.

We saw a wolf, bear and wild cats repetitively pacing around their enclosures in circles.... Going here for the views is worth it. I went during the day to miss the traffic and even then there was a wait for the shuttle.

Situated on outskirts on Udaipur and top of the mountain and offers excelled view of entire Udaipur city. This is also famous as sunset point. Once you've driven to the top the views over udaipur and the mountains are breath taking. That's the best bit by far. The palace is a ruin but you are still able to walk around it.

The problem is that the place belongs to the government which has made a forever project out of renovating it.The interiors look barely kempt, someone added a silly fountain... beautiful view, but the palace itself is a bit disappointing. Maybe after restoration? go in the evening with two hours left for sunset. you have to enter the wildlife park to get there. if you are a bird watched you would be rewarded along the route. the palace itself is in ruins with nothing much inside. the forest... we werent sure what this place was but our driver seemed insistent on us going. we drove further and further from the city and up into the hills over winding hairpin curves, until we got here...it was FAN.TAS.TIC. just beautiful, a wonderful respite from the... The day before going to the Monsoon Palace we had been to Ranakpur and Kumbalgarh, a trip that our hotel arranged. Although we hesitated on going to the Monsoon Palace we thought it was a good idea due to the great experience from the previous... We used to see this fort from our Hotel & wonder how this place will look. Finally we reached this fort.

This Fort Palace was & is still the Monsoon Palace for Maharana of Udaipur. This is the highest place in udaipur & the view... I totally recommend this place!! going there around 6:30 pm is the best idea... you feel all the nature around you and appreciating the sounds of the birds and wind is easy to do. The ticket price is worth it. I 've visited udaipur thrice and this is the best place there. The view of the whole city that you get from such a height is just amazing.
The experience of driving uphill and downhill will also be awesome if you have your own vehicle.... never thought before going....unexpected...amazing place with bbeautiful view to udaipur city I'm sorry to say that the place is very poorly kept, given the way that the City Palace and other places in Udaipur have been maintained. The drive to the top is good fun and the views from the Palace are obviously amazing, but apart... we enjoyed the beautiful sunset views of the city from this palace. Good place to visit, they arrange for some nice cultural shows also please call and find out and plan the visit accordingly.....There are nice small restaurants around where you could get some nice meals (and drinks) but it is better known for the view it... Anything worth seeing in Udaipur seems to stand on a hill, and so is this Palace, which was supposed to have been a place for astronomical study and ended up being a hunter's place. Nothing much to see inside, except for info on the various... If you want a romatic sunset or are an avid photographer then this is the place to be. Set in Sajjan Garh for which you have to pay entrance fee, this dusty uninteresting edifice with shoddy displays (such as they are) doesn't really merit the name palace. However, the views are good over the lakes of Udaipur. As for being set in a... Perhaps someday, it will be developed (and probably unaffordable for most of us), but for now, enjoy the view at sunset. Since you have now explored the white city of Udaipur, so musn't miss Sajjagarh. During my bachelorhood stay in this city, we used to drive our bikes up to these steeps hills during monsson to enjoy the scenic beauty of Udaipur on a birds eye... The palace itself is abandoned and not too impressive, but is well worth it for the sunset views. Not to mention the refreshing breeze! You can see all the surrounding countryside, as well as the city and its lakes and palaces, and can watch the... You have to pay a lot to get there....Autoricksaw to the entrance of the Park, then Jeeps  to take you up there...you only get some nice views from Udaipur, nothing else, the monument is small and falling apart, not preserved whatsoever. I feel strange being the only one not extatic about it. The palace is far from Udaipur, therefore the lake is hardly noticeable and it's in the opposite direction of the sun. But you can see well the chaotic urban sprawl of the town, hidden... The view alone is well worth the trip, the possibility of seeing a leopard en route makes it even better (we didn't). Best time to go is late afternoon (5:30ish) as the sunset over the hills is fabulous, as is the view back down to... This old hunting lodge has great potential as a tourist attraction, but they have done little with all the rooms.  The view of the sunset behind the surrounding hills is wonderful as well as the view of the city.  It was definitely worthwhile and I... Beautifully made fort on top of the highest point, overlooking the white city of lakes. The huge tanks covered within the walls of the palace for rain water harvesting, are amazing for the time when they were made. The view of the city from here... Drive up a steep hill to the fort. You will be amazed how they built a palace so high up. 

The scenery from up above is breath taking. The sunset is picture perfect.

If you tip the guy working at the palace, chances are he... I visited this place along with my friends. Its a nice place at a height to view both lakes of Udaipur, Pichola and Fateh Sagar. The udaipur City looks good from top and and one can get a good view of city palace and Udai... Well worth taking a taxi or you driver out at for sunset. Get there for 5.30 so you have some time exploring the building. Ignore the guide, official or not, he is not worth it, but the view over the hills is definately worth coming... We had a beautiful ride up the steep hill via a forest area...lovely 360 degree views of the city Great trip up to and down from the Palace - hairpin bends and precipitous drops.  The 360 degree views from the top are wonderful. It's worth a visit as a great place to take photos of the city, lakes and surrounding wildlife areas/hills. The palace itself isn't really terribly interesting. Whatever you do, don't hire a guide here!! -there's not that much to know. Get up, get's some photos,... This is the crumbling palace on top of the hill you see looking over Udaipur.  We asked our driver and guide to take us there.  The palace itself is fallilng apart and nothing to speak of.  But the view from up on top of the... Monsoon Palace gives you the beautiful landscape of sunset. Worth Watching. Reserve one evening for Lake Pichola and other for Monsoon Palce and Hotel Ambrai. If you have own vehicle, then go for it, but take care it should be powerful one, otherwise wait for... Marooned at the top of the mountains overlooking Udaipur is this desolite grey drap unattractive palace.  There are no staff, toilets and contents.  One or two of the balconies are in that much neglect that they are dangerous.  I am led to believe that they... I've visited Udaipur a few times before, but never been here. This is the most wonderful place in Udaipur and must be visited. Again, monsoon is the time to be here. Must feel the clouds and mist in your face from balconies of this palace.... OKAY.. not much breath taking..its famous for it sunset view.. surely it would have good view.. we missed it.a good panaromic view of aravali hills.. and can see whole Udaipur. Route to Sajjan Garh is hilly, and need to pay a lot for camera...Sajjangarh fort... \A great escape from the city , nice and quiet, grat views of Udaipur , worth a visit. worth experiencing the view & serenity of the palace on top of hill. great valley, mountain & city view especially in monsoon. Nicely maintained & picture perfect place. This fort is now under renovation ... but the view from sajjan garh is awesome ..  its not maintained ...but a very peacefull place make sure that you have no bad stomach or so because there is no shop or either toilets the palace itself is very disappointing and in a sad state of repair, although they are doing some work to restore it to how it must have once looked. Short distance outside of the city, but perhaps worth it for the stunning panoramic views and... Nice View from the Top of the Palace can be highlighted and maintained in a better way but still worth a visit. nice place to see the sunset, but a bit of a mission to get there involving a rickshaw (200rs return) wait for a taxi (100rs p/p return) apparently you can walk to the top from the gates of the wildlife sanctuary but its a long... Well on a mountain this place offers a good view of Udaipur town from above. The palace itself is not much of worth seeing. Rest room is available.No shops on the hill. Just go in the evening to see the sun set(IF NOT CLOUDY) or... One thing i loved about this place is the way to monsoon place. It is in midst of dense forest and surely a ride at night would scare the hell out. Nothing very special about the palace in particular apart from nice view or the... The place is not well maintained.. The place gives a fntastic view of the arawali mountains from the top. This old palace is in a stunning location at the top of a hill with spectacular views for miles, when the air is clear, but it has not been looked after like city palace so not worth it for the architecture etc. But we did... This is located a top the hills. excellent bird's eye view to the whole city of Udaipur and it's lakes. but there is no internal maintenance and not a jot on the city palace. The interiors are all in ruins and the walls are covered... Great place to spend the late afternoon and watch the sunset. You will need a driver rather than a tuktuk to get up, its a very steep climb. It might sound good to to take up a picnic: but dont do it! The moneys will... beautifull views and not overcrowded as busses don't have acces to this place. go there at night This palace built by a 25yr old to have fun and parties with his friends. had many interesting gardens and meeting places, great for sunset- could just imagine the wild affairs going on in this place. great views of the city 360 degree.worth the visit-go...

Bring a book with you and relax in the area for a... We went for the Sunset views, which were amazing.  The views overall are gorgeous.  The palace itself is completely run down, but you don't go there to see it.  On the way down the mountain a jaguar was in the road and we saw it... this palace was build for queens ,i love the view in short a must place to visit if u r in udaipur go early in the morning by 10 am. Take my rating of the place with a grain of salt as I did not actually make it to the monsoon palace.  You may have to get here much sooner than you think to catch the sunset and avoid my experience.  Rickshaws are no longer... We spent a beautiful evening here,come early(around 1-2 hrs before sunset) and enjoy the views here. The view it wonderful, of course, but the building itself is a shell. Pity - as from a distance it offers so much Romantic promise! views of he palace, lake and city are amazing. Lost fo monkeys on the top. The palace itself is not much to see, not furnished, empty and not very interesting architecture. But the draw is the view -- it sits on top of a hill with great view of area.  Nice sunset. Overlooking Udaipur city ,this offers the best view .The best time is Monsoon ,when its greenary all around and  especially if clouds are not hanging low,engulfing the palace.The sunset view it OK through out the year. make sure that you have no bad stomach or so because there is no shop or either toilets Plan to be at monsoon palace for Sunset. Views of the city are beautiful. We were there on a full moon evening and the beauty was obviously enhanced. This hilltop palace was never complete and still has the desolate look You can get there in several ways but its within a sanctuary and needs a ticket for you and your vehicle.Little wildlife is seen around though black faced langurs abound. You get  a... Puts all of Udaipur into perspective - not much or the original palace to see - lovely drive up - or better if you are fit and strong - a great walk! Great setting,  high on a hill over looking Udaipur, worth the windy drive to the top for the view. Not the best day to visit this site.  Buried so deep in cloud it was difficult to see the building let alone any of the views.

Delighted to see the protection around the nature reserve on the way up. 

I'll have to watch some Bond... The Monsoon Palace (Sajjan Garh) is known for its breath-taking sunsets and is a must-visit. The road is hilly and has numerous blind turns so if you are driving, be careful when negotiating them. The surroundings are lush green and the climate becomes cooler as... The aptly named Monsoon palace is cocooned in the clouds during the monsoon, but its true value lies in the fact that it isn't much of a palace as it was never completed or furnished as it was meant to be.

Udaipur,Rajiv Gandhi Park,"Relatively new park on the side of fateh sagar lake. Not the best with average look. Needs more improvement Rajiv Gandhi Park at Udaipur is relatively new park in Udaipur.

Pros:
Green lashes garden
Nice view of lake fatehsagar
No entry fees

Cons:
Toilet was ugly
Kid's jhulas were not maintained
Huge garbage around the garden
Kindly avoid to go... very good experience at rajiv gandhi park, which is situated in the lake. In night it looks very nice. It's just like any other public park with a big statue of Late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 
Nothing special except the scenic view of lake fatehsagar. It is a huge garden and provides you excellent view of Fatehsagar. It is very badly maintained despite of entry fee. Many fountains but very few are operated. Bad blue colour bathroom tiles make it more ugly. Garbage all across the garden. This could be such a beautiful place, because the setting is magnificent. It is ruined for me by the tacky decorations and completely inartistic layout of the gardens. Plastic gnomes is one thing in Europe - do we need plastic deer and plastic gods as...

Rajiv Gandhi Park situated on a hill,gives amazing sunset and sunrise views.The park is very well maintained and contains a spacious Children's park and a food court with delicious cuisines. This park is at the most beautiful location in the city, on the bank of lake Fatehsagar but it is poorly maintained.
A little bit of attention to maintainence and it will be a very beautiful place. I visited this place in Dec'16 and the weather just complimented the trip.

Udaipur,Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Park,"The park, which has recently been renamed to its present name, is not at all maintained by the municipal authorities.

Garden is divided in 4-5 section and each... It has a historical value but not well preserved. 

A big area as soon as you enter, where there are few old fountains (some of them are not functioning now) 

Just take a walk around and come out to visit the garden behind. 

Small walk... Best place for enjoy with friends and staying in green environment. And water system. That established in 18 century Saheliyon Ki Bari is where the queens/princesses from back in the days would hang out with the girlfriends.. & for good reason! The place is gorgeous, with lovely flowers and trees sprawled across the entire garden area.

On the downside - as the place barely... The only attraction of this place is just the small painting gallery inside it. You need only fifteen min to see the overall place.

The history of this place says the garden was used by the queen and her maids of honour.You'll find a lot of greenery here. I wouldn't call this place peaceful as it is very crowded during the peak season.
You can spend around an hour... Such a great place to be evidence of our technical expertise.
If you stay in a corner, it sounds like rain falling Dont miss this place amaz8ng monument. This is world famous foutains. Many movies were shooted here. One should see how the maharajas enjoyed there life in old times & that too luxury Sahelion ki bari turned out to be far more better than expected.

It took around 45 minutes, and we enjoyed the peacefulness of the gardens at the end. The... Awesome architechture and science. 
Very beautiful locations. Divided in different zones. Guided tour will help. Amazing play with water and physics Good place to see... You can sit here and  relax in the garden.. Small museum inside. This place is within the city. So easily you can reach. You can hire taxi.. Or Ola, Ola auto... Can be considered as a public park, few fountains are the landmark attractions. Be wary of a lot of hawkers here inside the premises. Not a must visit. Well, this place is nice and pretty to visit but not worth travelling so far if your hotel is not close to this place. It is wose to visit this place if you have other olsvdd yo visit closeby As there are not many places to visit in udaipur you may as well go there.for kids the traditional  dress photo shoots are worth taking.do not visit without a guide,the story is the only thing which will make you interested in the place. This place has around 5 fountains and covered with beautiful gardens. It a must visit place, also the ticket price was also minimal.

The place is quite spread out, hence, factor at least 20 - 30 mins walk. Walked around the garden, but not much else to do.

It was a nice garden. The fountains weren't spectacular...not ordinary at all. But it is a nice garden, saw some butterflies on flowers. It is not certainly an extra-ordinary garden.

very interesting feature is stopping n starting the fountain with a clap sound This is a perfect place to have a picnic and for couples who just want to take a stroll through the gardens.

The only downside is the number of touts in the inner courtyard who insist on selling you different kind of camera... This is a good place to add to your trip if you are near Fatehsagar lake.

If you love walking in garden then probably you want to come here otherwise there is nothing to quote as such. Garden is always crowded with people but could not understand the reason.
It holds no significance whatsoever. Its a plain and simple garden.
It has entry fees of 5 rs(not a big amount) which is a joke not worth a penny. This is the well maintained garden but nothing special in it. If having spare time then I recommend to visit it. Ideal time is after sunset so proper lighting makes it as its ornament.

A popular evening spot among the localites...this place remotely connects to anything of historical importance Excellent place to visit, take a guide to enjoy the place and also get some pics clicked by him The concept is great - the place when it would have been made was certainly brilliant - and in many ways ahead of its times. What now remains is just a memory of the times.

I had visited Udaipur when I was a teenager some 40 years ago. The waterfall from the umbrella was very uniform and we could go inside and stand in the umbrella and could feel the water falling  which... An amazing piece of construction, the story goes that a princess asked her father for rain outside of monsoon season: everyone else would ask him for things and he would grant them, so why shouldn't she? The daughter was indulged, and thus the garden was... Nice garden with fountains!! Went here in August , it was raining which added to the beauty of this garden. Nice surrounding, big doors, lush landscapes,and beautiful fountain can spend 1 hr or less depending upon how busy you are. As per the legends this... Its a nice place to go for a walk, but this place really needs maintenance. The fountains were out of order when we visited. We didn't find anything interesting, if you are running short of time, you can give it a miss. This place has nothing to admire! It's just a park with some fountains that are not even working properly. Waste of time! Certainly not the best attraction of Udaipur and we actually drove around, trying to find it... Go if you need to kill time otherwise there is some great shopping on this street including gems, artwork - The real deal. The grounds are certainly pretty and maybe I missed something but I didn't see much.  It would have been nice if there were benches to sit and relax, but I guess they want people to keep moving through.  It is nice on a hot day. Large quiet gardens with ornate fountains. Relaxing. Lots of gardens, didn't realize there was a garden just for ladies.  It would be fun to picnic there.  The locals like to take your picture. If Rajasthan conjures images of sandy and hot desert the Saheliyon ki bari was meant to give you respite from the heat of that image.Set in resplendant gardens there are several water bodies and fountains which cool the air and allow happy breeze to blow.The... Neat and clean.. well maintained..  just ok for a small outing and view the beauty of this boutique garden.. Quiet and cool with a great break from the noise and chaos of the city. We enjoyed wandering the paths and hearing the fountains throughout the gardens. Liked the cleanliness,order,colour sounds of the birds.......
was a real pleasure to be there..... Only takes 10-15 minutes to walk around, the royal ladies certainly had a special place to relax. Very picturesque.  Lots of water and fountains and for once a garden in India with some flowers... and that attracts a multitude of interesting insects and beautiful butterflies Sahelion ki Bari is one the most beautiful gardens and a major tourist destination in Udaipur. The garden is famous for its sprawling lush green lawns, marble art and fountains and was built in the 18th century by Maharana Sangram Singh for the royal ladies.... Yes, there are greneries around.. with fountain but... i have to say its not interesting....
spent only 10 minutes in there avoidable if running short of time, but better time spent than seeing different lakes over and over again.

 no need for a guide, though they will insist. Greens and fountains is what makes Saheliyon ki Badi the perfect place for a good walk and light talk! Perhaps the garden created for the maidens was purposefully designed such that one could be one's natural self within a natural premise. I would love to... The gardens were made for a group of young women attendants who accompanied a princess to Udaipur as part of her dowry. Today they are a welcome break from seeing a fort or palace. The gardens are pleasant but not stunning.  They consist of various... This used to be the place when I visited few years back, but is not well maintained. Fountains are almost out of order. Still it's beautiful and with some imagination you can feel how this place must have been. Not a place to visit..it have just old fountains.. and a garden..we had better fountains in Lucknow..not well managed.. only good thing it have cheap photos available in Rajasthani dress..its better if u can visit baddi ka talab with still water and perfect reflection of... Beautiful place. Do hire a guide to learn about the history associated with the place. We had a busy schedule, but our travel guide squeezed an hour-long excursion to the gardens. I agree that perhaps more should be done to maintain the gardens because they really are lovely and deserve attention. If you feel you need a breather from visiting... These gardens are a great way to escape the heat of the city. A quiet relaxing stroll through the pleasant fountains and lush greenery is the ideal way to soothe the soul after the screaming chaos of the narrow streets of Udaipur. Take time out... Disappointed visiting the Bari as i had been here years back and this time iast has lost complete charm and looks like left aside place by tourism dept. as it is not at all maintained. all fountains have stopped working and plantation also need to...",24.602987900000002,73.68519323350773

The place was very crowded and buzzing with tourists.

Lots of stalls to shop around. I have been to this place earlier as well. The prices during festival is relatively high but so are the options. As a local Indian i did not find this much exciting.

Reading other reviews and looking at... Its a collection of Rajasthani culture captive in one big field.

The houses are very photogenic, but it would be nice if they were furnished to show how people... Shilpgram is a rural development initiative. It is very far away from city and not actually worth to go. Number of shops from different states are their but too overpriced. Show of local people performing Rajasthani dance and songs is worth watching. It is a big complex with lots of ideas. But when I went it was practically all the stalls were empty.

Many small museums are present with different rural themes from different parts of India. However none of them are well maintained or well marketed. Lack of maintenance in sculpture gallery is evident... Shilpgram is basically a place which tries to showcase Rural India. One can witness traditional rural artists perform, shop for handicrafts and clothes made in the villages in cottage industries here. The place can be much better projected and showcased if more basic infrastructure like... As accepted Rajasthani culture ... Rajasthani music...

Keep in mind to inquire from local people if they are having any fair before going... It was wonderful visiting the mela. The products are well-priced. Of course, you bargain to reach the decent price. The people are nice. No groping/eve-teasing incidence so I would say Excellent just for that. In a crowd that big, it's hard to manage. No pushing,... The fair is very big and has good collection of local artisian works. Must visit during the fair held in December. we ended up having another day in Udaipur due to travel connection delays so went to look at the much talked about festival.

The handicrafts are very nice & exclusive which we may not be finding in the regular market.  But for people who know the value of the items, I find them to be bit highly priced. We went in september and the place was nearly closed .... Extremely good concept but not maintained... Its a rural articles shopping mall if working properly.... Its a small man made village to give visitors a feel of Rajasthani culture. You can see folk dance , buy all sorts of decorative items.

Shilpgram is a lovely handicraft paradise, especially during the end of December during the Annual Shilpgram Fair when artists from all over the country come together and present their wares in this rustic village setting of Shilpgram in Udaipur.

December end is a great time... This is actually you call it a shopping village. which is running by goverment. All goverment authorised ppl comes to this place and make a shop there.

3. Good performances without any extra charge.
 

advice: most of the area is open, do carry an... The artisans and craftsmen at Shipgram have crazy talent and the initiative by the govt. to give them this space is an commendable. However, much needs to be done to enhance the experience of the people visiting. Be cautious when shopping. Some of the artisans are fabulous and honest, but there are those that sell without full disclosure.

A couple that have a permanent place in Shilpgram and make earthen pots do fantastic work, and are completely down to earth! Very reasonable... we visited shilpgram during our trip to udaipur. It is near to monsoon palace so plan it next to ur visit to monsoon palace. There are groups of tribals who perform traditional dance for you and even invite u to shake a leg with them.... We had a great time visiting Shilpgram. The people were very friendly and not pushy. We bought some beautiful needle work from Garg Handicraft. Mr Saroop Chand is a real gentleman and craftsman. Loved the music, dancing and costumes. It's not a sophisticated place and... Paradise for photographers with lots of activities. One can get a flavor of Rajasthani culture & village life style. Its a place where you get to see the cultures of 4 states i.e. Rajasthan, Gujrat, Goa and Maharastra. Artists from these 4 states who has done some tremendous work in their field has showcased their art. We all friends decided to go Shilpgram for making memorable moments and time pass but all high expectation related to Shilpgram was become bad.There is nothing to buy even we cannot find anything to buy.Prices are soo high
Overall I dnt like shilpgram Good place to have a look and buy some traditional rajasthani craft and household items. Also good for people who want to buy some traditional dress and bandini material. Would not say it is a must visit but a good place to spend around 2... Not sure if many people go there as it is not highlighted well. We visited this place which resembles a village. You get a chance to go inside the huts, dance, sing with folk artists, apart from shopping the eco friendly stuff like toys or... It is very far from the city and  is basically aimed at foreign travellers  to give insight into arts and crafts of tribal rajasthan. The items are more expensive than in general market. This is place which should visited by all art and architecture lovers. a  place  which exhibit various regional hut, culture . It has a sculpture garden , which a must visit place. tastefully made right next to Amantra Shilpi Resort, Shilpgram has a lot of vernacular homes from the states of gujrat, rajasthan etc. built out of mud, laterite and stone. there are also shops selling handicrafts but it is only during festivals that the shops are... Nothing great if you have visited other hatt in various cities. it seems to be still under construction good place where u can see rajastani folk music and dances, esp. the music without mic is very good. dont buy saree without checking only 4.5 m. This is a nice thing to do around Christmas, there are craftsmen from all over India that come to sell there products as well as lots of different food to try.  Make sure you take a bottle of water and your camera.  A rickshaw ride... This is the place we liked the most in Udaipur.At our visit, the annual fair that takes place in December end, was ongoing. The entertainment, folk dances, cultural programmes, the entire atmosphere, everything was just superb. We regretted that we did not spare much time... A place worth a visit to see the local traditions and handicraft. However, the quality of the goods sold were not worth the price asked for. This happens only Dec 21 to Dec 31st every year. It is worth planning a trip to Udaipur ONLY for this!!!

They create an entire village with artisans, musicians, craftsmen, snake charmers, dancers, magicians, imitators, folk dancers, etc from ALL OVER INDIA. Exhilerating food, sounds,... There is a shop in the city named Shilpgram which I found good and reasonable. You will find sareers of banana and jute silk and cotton. Also you can find local made artificial jewellery Clearly it looks like a great place to visit. A good representation of different states/cultures/arts. But it seems timing it is really important. When I went to there around noon, there were very few performers and only a few shops open. The performers are likely... This place is very easily accessible by road and has ample paid parking. You need to spend a good amount of time of at least 3 hours to see the place end to end. We have run out of time and came back in between.... The Shilpgram Cultural Festival in late December is well worth a visit.  Don't arrive early; it opens at 10 am but there's little action until around lunch time and the place really gets going much later in the day. Singing, dancing, colorful native outfits and... You can groom around in shilpgram just to see theme and concept but
Don't buy anything from there, if you really want to buy something then go to local market at hathi pole. In shilpgram they charge higher in most items. 
Also food quality was... Its a place not to be missed. A shopping Paradise filled with items of art and craft . Food stalls filled with tasty items and Cultural programs fill the day Hugely satisfying experience getting to see handicraft and culture at large from all states of the nation at a common place. If it is going on while you are there, just drop in but keep atleast half a day aside. You'll definitely thank me later.... This is the place where you want to spend your time in December when the world is here in large number. Most part of shops / huts were closed but I still enjoyed what even was available. Food inside the restaurant is excellent ! Specially... This is an interesting concept of the villages of the Hill Country Tribes.  There are also the Tribal people in their traditional outfits performing music and dance.  One way of connecting with the many customs, dress etc of the hill tribal people recommended during the festival season, interesting to see the various artisans and craftmanship in villages (esp. if you come from urban cities), tickes are a bit expensive This is a place one should only think about if they are in Udaipur in last week of the year. You can expect a verity of food there with lost of lights. Different drama on each day from different part of India. It is great place to visit specially for those who lives in urban cities and have not seen villages, very well maintained, the performances inside is very good, and should be appreciated. There are also sort of flea market inside and I would suggest you... This place is run by the government organisation & offers only 2 things , 
Cultural show of songs , dance , Puppet show & village life which are a regularly performed every evening , please check the show timings , we went around 6pm for... Very good place to shop for local crafts, need strong bargaining skills for several things.. must visit for shopholoics we made a whole day out of this. I got to see so many dances and dramas from various parts of India and the stalls and shops are a good place to find some great deals. Scored myself a beautiful saree and some Jaipur Bangles... We visited the place guided by a guide we met at the entry. People there are not traying to rip off, they are good people, real artists, every rupee worth it, we did not even try to negotiate, the prices were very fair.

the guide... Performances from around India, handicrafts from each zone (N,E,W,S) every year, and festivities all around. A nice place to be at for those who have some time to spare in the evenings. Loved the place.Got a chance to know about the lives of traditional Rajasthani folks. Also had a chance to see the making of woollen shawls which was a good experience. We struggled a bit to find the place though. Few additional signboards would have helped... I enjoyed a lot my visit to Shilpgram during the festival. I didn't assist to any dance program but I liked the place a lot, all huts and paintings, and handicraft. The only minus point is that I expected to find more hight quality handicraft... A visit to shilgram in Dec is really worth the time. May be a purpose of visit in Dec should be just to explore the true heritage of INDIA. A must visit place during December. 

A full day visit @ the place would not be... I found name of this place in a brochure having tourist attraction places in Udaipur and one staff from the hotel where I stayed sugeeted me this place alongwith Nathdwara temple and Eklingaji's temple as places of must visit. I was overwhelmed after visiting Srinathji... The place is well maintained and gives a peek into culture of the place and its people. We were lucky to visit on a day when the 10-day annual festival that sees stalls from various states. It also has a cultural programme every evening. It... I've been staying in Udaipur for a few months now and have been to Shilpgram a couple of times - every time I go, it's more or less deserted of artists (except at the festival, I'll get there in a bit). I know plenty of... Florida's Epcot Center is great for those who don't have the chance to travel outside the US. It could be said that this place might be good for those who don't have a chance to travel around India....and maybe that is true. However, we found... A very sad and sorry alternative to chowki dhani.  Shilp Gram felt like a dilapidated place, looking only to make money but not of any value.  We leaft in about 10 minutes after entering it. Not different from the countless handicraft exhibitions held in every Indian city. The folk program is nice though. I like this place as it was a collection of whole india. You can see the different tradition/culture of India. It is so beautifully organized by Indian govt. There is lot of things which you can purchase. lucky to be part of a 10 day extensive Mela - managed getting great bargains in products depicting the cultural heritage of rajasthan. The shilpgram mela was just like any other crowded mela with bloated prices of everything. Its not very huge fair ...if just walking (without bargaining and purchasing anything), you can complete the tour of this fair in 7-8 minutes. Some traditional stuff in this fair... I am giving 5 rating because i have visited this place in the last week in December. This place is celebrated as ""Shilpgram Festival 2013"" during this time.
The major attraction is  live performance of folk artist ant that is very attracting. Crafts Bazar is... We went on 26th Dec, there was a fair going on there from 22-31 dec, so besides the stalls of different states , there was a cultural show of different dances from different states of India.Excellent show, much better than Bagore ki Haveli show. The... Shilpgram is one of the places which is recommended by almost everyone in Udaipur (by the locals as well as the people who have visited the place). The concept is really nice, it is well thought off, you get to see a lot of Rajasthani... this is one place which has lots to offer to people in terms of craft/ handicraft, culture etc.
It has replica of various type of houses in india like different type of houses in goa, maharatsra, north east and so on which you will not... If you love handicrafts and likes to experience local creativity, head straight to Shilpgram. I was amazed with the crystal work, micro painting and the unique clothes on display. Further, I found the prices very reasonable. It is a village setup which display rajasthan tribal tradition(Huts, Dance)... Far off from city... Arrange Auto or Taxi from Udaipur itself for up and down... 1-2 hour is enough to see everything... Better to visit it during Dec' end, Shilpgram festival will be conducted... We spent an entire evening there. good music food and definitely great hospitality.... We saw teh dances, spent some realx.. time , palm reading, interacting with people.. It was one of the few places we did hire a local guide as we walked into the place on the recommendation of our tour company. Glad we did without him I feel you would be walking around not understanding what is what.

The center... Its a huge complex however number of shops are less. You can buy local handicrafts, clothes, etc from here at reasonable cost. If they can increase the number of shops and perhaps a couple of good eating joints this place can be a big hit. This is a wonderful little artists village that gives you a real insight into how people live in other parts of India and rural lands, past and present.  It features architecture and artists from Rajasthani, Gujarati and Maharashtrian who actually live and work in this... you get good products here and a real feel to a village. However, dont compare it to Choki-Shani of Jaipur. good collection of bed-sheets and other rajasthani products You can visit Shilpgram after your visit to the Monsoon Palace. Shilpgram is interesting. It exposes you to Rajasthani, Gujarati and Maharashtrian culture. The artists inside Shilpgram take that extra effort to explain their art and techniques. Of course, they also try to sell their... I saw the kathputali show first time and hence I liked the place. There is also a collection of puppets from different countries as a museum. You also get to see different dress and other things about rajasthani culture which is good if you are... Every one should visit this place....specially those people who are from metros... to feel the life of tribes and villagers. To feel the Rajasthani art & music, Dance etc.
Excellent place and must visit place I dont know how people can rate it good.There was nothing there.shops were in terrible condition this place was not maintained at all .waste of money You dont have to force yourself to a 'must see and sign off' situation here....plenty of walking space and somthing differant and original. Some awesome performances....no Bose systems but you can get very close to the original sounds of 'out of it' music of Rajasthan... An attraction no less of the Rural Arts and Crafts Complex is the open air Amphitheatre with a seating capacity of approximately 8000. Besides the major theatre festivals which the Centre hold here, it is hoped that this facility would motivate the local community as... Surrounded by Aravalli Mountains, lies the scenic and beautiful Shilpgram - Home to the West Coast artisans - Mainly Rajasthani, Gujrati, Maharashtrian & Goan all showcased in the village surroundings with mud huts and an atmosphere of local village haat showcasing articles of daily use.... Just a little out of town but that could make for a nice drive in case you've already had a few days of relaxation. I read the reviews that it is not worth going...but i still wanted to go and see. And my visit to shilpgram did not disappoint me. It is a nice village shopping place. Few great artists inside.. check with the shopkeepers next to the main... Very few stalls were operational when we visited it this year. Most have been there for the last 2 years . So we couldn't find anything of interest or new. Considering that Rajasthan is handicraft land, it is a pity that new artistes and artisans... This fest is to picture the culture, not only the Rajasthan but complete India.
For many Indians it may not worth it as they have seen such things many times and even many people are not interested in all this stuff.
The place is made... You get feeling of being in older India. Although not a great place but you get handicraft items at a relatively cheaper rate here. They do a lot of marketting to sell their products and probably it worth buying it from here. A must visit to know about the various cultures of our country. You shall be treated with an array of Folk Dance performances. 
The handicrafts being sold here are much cheaper than those sold in shops in the city.
Worth a visit. If you like Indian dance, only then it is worth the effort to go. But you can spend your time better somewhere else. It is OK, lots of booths and shops selling handicrafts, jewelry, shoes, textiles, miniature, etc.  They all try very hard to sell you something as with the shops in Old Town.  The buildings and structures are OK, but not that exciting. The live dancers and singers was worth it. Avoid the shops inside as they try to force you to buy stuff from them. The museum of antiques is also good. it has almost everything you might want to shop in udaipur. they have all kinds of arts and handicrafts. i was rushing through as i was getting late for darohar at bagore ki haveli. i saw some beautiful things. gods, elephants, tortoises, etc made from... This is the place we liked the most in Udaipur.At our visit, the annual fair that takes place in December end, was ongoing. The entertainment, folk dances, cultural programmes, the entire atmosphere, everything was just superb. We regretted that we did not spare much time... Shilpgram is a village near Udaipur and famous for fair which occur once in a year. If you want the glimpse of the traditional folk dance and clothing, this is the place for you. We were disappointed with the place. Just two groups performing. No tourists. Poor facilities. Not worth going but yes the drive around fateh sagar was enjoyable. This place was very run down & scruffy with rubbish strewn everywhere.  I was very disappointed with my visit.  Quite a few of the little houses/huts etc were locked up so you couldn't see them.  It looked like a 'ghost town'.  There were several little... Me and my wife loved this place and it was so amazing with so many traditional folk artists performing. They performed from their heart and welcomed us with teir open arms. I even lost myself with them and did try my hands on one of... If you intend to meet the locals & dont know how, or explore how the common people in Rajasthan are like & their art, culture,music, architecture, this is a good place. There are tribal dancers & singers performing at times along the lanes. Huts are... it is very ordinary nothing much. just a village concept created with nothing great to talk about. very average It's of historical interest, with re-creations of life in Rajastan before the British Raj, but a bit too artificial, and one is overly beset by hawkers with con-man lines. Its a craft mela which held every year in December. Its like Sujarkund Mela in Delhi. If you skip it you will not miss something very important. If you have spare time then only you can visit. Not worth spending time here, as nothing great in this place. There are some exhibitions going on, but there are dime a dozen such handicraft exhibitions in any place in India This is a place very far from city. ticket is overpriced, even for camera they charge INR100. there is nothing to click. as we have bought ticket , we clicked photos & uploaded for you all. please donot buy ticket for camera.good for kids(not every)... This is a terrible place to loot money out of the general tourist pockets. Avoid this place. As soon as you enter, the shop keepers inside start harassing you to buy their products. Only in December, there is some handicraft fair here. Maybe it can... good for kids to learn different cultures with life size models of our rajasthani gujrati and maharashtrian style homes..puppet show and folk songs are free here..you can buy hadicraftys also at a good price.. Shilphram is one of the best places in Udaipur, especially in December when the fair is organised. Here, one can find all sorts of artisans from all over India. During my visit, I was mesmerised by the local art and the many dance programs organised... First impressions its a beautiful concept to get all the best of artisans from rajasthan and its neighbouring states together in one forum. Also each one them being unique and magnificient in what they did was also a plus point.  But what was lacking was... In December of every year,a festival is being organised there where the specialties of every state comes there and the dancers from every states comes to perform.Every eve they used to perform .It is a great time pass in December.But it is quite far from... When we entered Shilpgram, we were surprised that it had very  few visitiors. Once we moved around, we realise that there were lots of talented artists at this place. We did shop for paintings, bedsheets, crystals etc. You will find various artist from different stated performing their art & skills which is OK.You will also find food stall for there famous Dal Batti whici is also OK not as per the standard We were in Shilpagram Udaipur in Oct 2011 during Diwali along with my family and we met a wonderful Glass crystal of a Ganeshji diety under a Parijath Tree. I could not trace the number of the artist/Karigar and if someone could help me contact... Can be very well avoided!! Not worth the time and energy you end up spending! We travelled a lot to reach there and realised there nothing to do. They have a kind of festival twice a year which was already finished. The food was extremely... We were lucky to have been in Udaipur for the Rajasthan craft festival held every December. We were informed of this special event by a tuk-tuk driver. We got there by tuk-tuk. It will cost you between 100 and 150 rupees one way per tuk-tuk.... During our stay in Udaipur, fortunately for us the Shlipgram exhibition was on. The exhibition is phenomenal and seems its there ever year from 21-Dec to 28-Dec (not sure of the end date). Its a place you should not miss (exhibition) not only for the... There was amazing variety of products from all over India. the quality of goods was also very good. Also, there were various shows going on and the environment was very lively.

The area is very huge and takes atleast 2 hours to see. If probably... One stop shop for all shopping, entertainment purposes. Ideal place for tourists. Artistic display of workers from all across India. Music, Dance and Games for all. Nearby Fatehsagar lake, auto is the best way to reach Shilpgram... This was one good place we did some shopping. You can get traditional footwear, bags, show pieces here. you may find lots of shops but the only really good thing is to go to the open ari theater and enjoy all the shows performed by artist of all over india.

the music and dance is great and you get a chance to enjoy... This mela or fair is organized once a year in December and runs for about 10-14 days. It has huge number of shops of goods made by tribals, villagers or different state people. You can find clothers, handicrafts, pottery, woolen clothes, rugs, decorative items, metal... the fair in december is too good which attracts millions of people every year in the month of december The place is a not worth visiting. Very poorly maintained and mismanaged. Its in shambles and nothing worth seeing.
Its an insult to Indian Handicraft Artisans. 
Rajasthan Government should really take a relook at the place.
It is spread in a vast area but needs... A perfect place to visit if you want to explore the lifestyle and culture of Rajasthan. Local artists perform various acts in evening, there are shops for hand made items by local artists. 
Best time to visit: Last week of December.

The place is an artificial village made by West Zone Cultural Center of India. for promotion of village art and the Indian culture to all foreign and the Indian people. so they can know the Indian culture and the Indian art in a better manner.... It is a wide spread display of handicrafts from Rajasthan but stalls tend to get repetitive. You can get the same products in any handicraft exhibition in your city.

Nice place for Rajasthani Village experience..It was inagurated by Rajiv Gandhi.. and must go for Udaipur visit.. ur tour start with Bhil Dance, Camel trip, nice village house, folk dancers, adivasi - tribal museum, puppet show, kumhar (earthen pot maker).. nice rajasthani clothes made by... Just doesn't bear any resemblance to any village I have ever visited in India. It was very clean and quiet, no vehicles or residents in sight. Although the last week in November is a little early in the season, I would have liked to have... As I had visited Udaipur before, I thought of trying my luck and was completely happy with half I day visit to Shilpagram, where the government has made efforts to preserve the rural art and have recreated corresponding village surroundings.

During our visit the place... The place was quite empty, we we're the only ones there December 1st . I'm sure it gets better! This tourist trap is not even fully set up yet and, as is, it is not worth visiting. Most tour groups avoid it like the plague. It is supposed to be a representative collection of life in villages around India. It fails miserably. Only a... The place had hardly any artisans when we went, but the ones that were there had really good wares to sell. Authentic & well priced with a lot of variety to choose from, we did land up doing a decent amount of shopping at here. This is the best event which happens once every in Nov/Dec. It just few kilometers away from city center. Lots of local food, folk dances. A heaven for people who want to shop ornaments, decorative items, home furnishings, the list is looonggg... just be there... if you are looking for a village experience and are travelling to other places in Rajasthan, you can find much better options in Rohetgarh and Jodhpur dhurri villages...

What you get from this place depends largely on when you visit. First time we came here it was virtually deserted - just a few handicraft shops and a small dance display. The repro village houses and the ethnic museum were interesting. Second time we... we rode bikes there.  the ride was fun, but i wasn't into the village.  you have to pay to get in, and once you're there everyone is trying to sell you stuff.  there is a museum in there, but i wasn't that into it.

We decided to spend some time with friends in Udaipur and visit Shilpgram, it was the festival an amazing spectical... Thought this might be too contrived or twee but it was really interesting. A chance to see people from ther rural areas displaying their crafts and culture. We spent a couple of hours here and I wish we had more. There were some lovely painters, weavers and potters. Reasonably priced though we did bargain a little and direct contact with the artists as opposed to merchants. There were also some folk musicians... This place is a missable.  There is nothing much.  Time waster. Shilpgram is such an amazing way to potray lives in rural Rajasthan. There is ample to see inside. Two folk shows were performed by two different groups. Camel rides were organised. Tried my hands on pottery, wanted to do that since a long time. The... Loved the idea of this place just to get a view on the different types of housing, art, dance etc.  Sadly it was not able to offer anything other than the actual re-constructed houses.

We went and because of the offseason all the stores and services were closed so i only recommend going from september on. The dances and singing groups were very energetic and friendly. The service in the restaurant was horrible, the only thing they could offer... a little expensive, but it is all that rajasthan can offer you. it is easy to lose your mind and buy more than you can carry! Visit when the fair begins, when the whole village comes live... so much of culture and so much of variety in everything in this village right from the handicrafts to food and don't miss the cultural shows...it is worth visiting. This is where you got the jackpot. Lot of times, hotel guys and other folks will rule this place out. But in our whole Udaipur trip, this was THE best place that we visited. I can't talk enough about it. And for Rs 200, i... Quite place on way to Sajjangarh...fantastic for handicrafts, indian ethenic crafts, clothings and some entertainment. D Good to go around seeing the cottages made in style of five states - Rajasthan, Goa, Maharasthra, Gujarat, Kutch etc. The handicrafts are good and cheaper than outside. Camel ride for the young ones is an emjoyable affair. A waste of time for me. Was expecting to see a lot of Rajasthani traditional stuff but just found a couple of shops around with a few stalls from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The only saving grace was a few works of pottery This place has a lot of potential to be really great.  Apparently is best when it is festival time but was pretty quiet and dull during our visit.

The performances inside are nice. Few shopkeepers inside bug for purchase, but if you can ignore them and enjoy this place. Check before U go if it's working or not. We went there and there were very few artists. My son rode a camel which he liked very much. 2 groups of folk singers, 1 pupet show and 2 cotton sellers. It looked deserted, most of... The village setting is an instant relaxation tool. The local artisans put up a great show and various cottage-industry products are simply too good to pass. Don't miss the tie-and-die sari making and the artist who paints with his nails Shipgram is window to Rajasthan art. Every corner had some artistic view and everything was a feast to the eye.Wall paintings were almost talking. I liked the little huts with art work explained and displayed very artistcally. Folk dances and music took me to a... An extensive fair showcasing Indias rural potential.

Though quite far from Udaipur (150+ Kms ) towards Banswara Road but good place to visit this place during Navaratra festival. Statue of Tripura Sundari Mata (Kali Mata) is made up off single black stones. People from various parts visits here. This is a Kali temple and is visited by lot of people.
