There are many things to see ie. mummies, panting, sculptural, ancient weapons to see the strong and cultural india. If you are person who likes to explore history - you will love this place - you must have time if you want to actually go through with details it carries with each item it hold inside - on average it may take minimum 2-3... you will love taking a walk around this place and he cafe is a must visit I always like this place serving lovely tidbits SIncerely for history buffs,

This is one wonderful place in Jaipur. Nice collection of things such as pottery, weapons used during King time and changing pattern with time, dresses, musical instruments etc. if you want to spend some time while in jaipur you can go there. with its rich heritage the museum has pathetically less to offer to discerning tourist. don't compare it to van gog""s Holland or the louver . just stroll around.

3. The weapons section is too good

6. Indian history well showcased. Alber Hall Museum is the best i have seen in India. For those wanting to know about the history and culture of the Rajasthan kings this is a must see. Very well organized and exhibited. This one seems to me of relative less interest, although they usually include it in the visits. For me, give a photo of the facade and spend time to monuments of higher level and cultural land. It is very beautiful heritage building 
Now also used a museum
Also used for state events and functions 
Popular for movies and serial shoots This is a central museum situated in the central in the city. View of the building and garden from front side means from New Gate is really awesome and perfect.

The parking persons  does not  give authorised bill to the visitors While in Jaipur, One would surely pass through the Ramnivas Bagh, a lovely garden developed centuries ago, when perhaps, developing such gardens was not a routine affair.

This building was build to honor King Edward VII... With beautiful looks really great .it is in the busy & traffic area .short  visit is enough to this hall If you have already visited the City palace and Amer,then the Albert Hall will not be of much interest.
The museum gets monotonous and in trying to compile too many civilizations under one roof,it gets all haphazard.
The only thing worth watching is the frescoes... Gives a good glimpse of history. Conveniently located, not far from other main attractions of the city. One can see ancient guns, swords . dresses, books etc etc . Front view of the museum is really amazing.

A large surrounded lawn and open space make it beautiful.

Visited in November 2015. The museum is like any other museum...you can spend some time wandering about clicking snaps etc. but definitely not as grand as the forts of Jaipur. You can visit if you are a history buff and have enough time to spare amongst other Jaipur attractions This museum may not the best in terms of collection of artefacts but the building that houses it is amazingly beautiful.

Not only at 100 rupees per person is it well priced but it... This museum was not worth a visit in our minds.

Worth a quick visit if you have the time but it's not really much of a museum. There's some notable displays but on the whole not terribly exciting and all a bit hotch-potch. To summarise the building is more interesting than it's contents. Place is filled with ancient stuff cloths armoires and pots it's a good place to visit for some one who is interested in history and culture don't forget to get the audio guide quite helpful. The place is average. There are a bunch of paintings, some old musical instruments, some old royal dresses, some other stuff which is average- Can be seen if you have time or can be avoided, if you don't. Nothing spectacular! this museum is really great. it has all the antique collection of old maharaja's . a must visit for all the travellers The Albert Hall museum is situated exactly opposite to the New Gate which looks beyond the pink walls of the heritage city of Jaipur. The architectural magnificence of the building is breath-taking and invites locals and tourists to capture them through their lenses. Tourists are... I was very impressed by the richness, variety and the quality of the collection.  I think this place is undeservingly underrated in reviews.  It's certainly worth 5 stars. I loved the murals on the walls depicting various cultures/epics like Mahabharata to Egyptian. Rest all was fine. This is a good place to visit only if your into history and have some interest of the culture as this is not very huge like other museums of the world but a place you can visit once, I am a history junkie hence I love museums! Albert hall is an old hall converted to a museum as per the visionary of a King. It contains some really good artifacts, hand made clothes, armory etc from the times of the Kings. 

It is... Gorgeous building. I'm sure if you're into museums, there would be something here for you, but I found it a bit passè.

The best part of this museum is the building that it's housed in.

You will find various dresses , HAs a  bit  of  stuff  from everywhere  including  a  mummy  and is modelled  on  Londons  Victoria and Albert   Museum.
Good peopel watching  place and interesting palce  to visit but  as a  museum  per say its  weak A random mixture of things to see - does not take much time; Personally found the architecture outside and the local visitors in their traditional clothes more interesting than most of the exhibits, thought the weaponry and the musical instruments were interesting. If you have a few extra hours to spend in Jaipur, do visit the Albert hall museum, with its rare artefacts and friendly staff. It also has toilet facility and a cafeteria. Zoo is also located nearby. This is so unexpected to find this tribute to Albert Hall. Viewing the paintings and learning the history of each is so interesting The building of this museum is realy perfect for photoshots however the place in itself is quiet boring. I was tired and was thinking about skipping this one but glad I went . Lots of things , even a egyptian mummy .
Sadly things are not well preserved or marked. If you have time you see it Boring by and large. Only thing you can find is Egyptian Mummy in this museum. The adjoining zoo can be enjoyable for kids. You will also get a horse ride at the circle. Our cab driver suggested we budget 30 mins for this, the ticket was a mere Rs 20, so we weren't expecting much. We could not have been wrong,  

The hall does have a great collection of pottery, metal work, paintings and statues. Not to mention... I like this place more than I thought I would.  It is crammed full of artifacts and history and is good for a wander.  Some beautiful items which give you an idea of how skilled the Indian crafts people are.  Some interesting items in a... The displays of the past, well preserved for posterity to see, remember and appreciate was good. How the king made a place for Albert for his visit was commendable Created by the British to showcase items of cultural significance from within India and from the rest of the world it is a strange collection of originals and recreations. It does feel that the collection was put together to demonstrate British 'worldliness' to local viewers.... Just like any poorly maintained South Asian museum - with the added drawback of not having a cohesive collection. It looks and feels just like an eccentric colonial's trophies. Don't waste your money on the audio guide. The outside of the building is FAR more... We visited the place on Sunday though it was crowded. 
The place as named is having all ancient collections of dresses and weapons used by rajput kings.
Try to explore all floors and understand the sequence among them.
Please visit in evening time so that... A decent museum in Jaipur, which can be visited as part of the joint ticket available from the Amber Fort. Various weaponry and sculpture displays. Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful building and it has so much potential! Unfortunately, as with so many other museums in India it is not being looked after enough. The pieces get lost in the bad lighting conditions. The exhibition could be much... very good photo op and a good visit to know a bit about the history of the place as well
Also, you would notice a fair few flocks of pigeons outside Albert Hall providing good photo ops Well all museums are same (if you are an idiot).
Else this museum is a great place to spend an entire day and get mesmerized with the beauty that lies within.
Items ranging from old bayonets to Chinese civilization to Egyptian Mummies, you can find... Wonderful place with incredible atmosphere. We were the only foreigners that day, but the museum was crowded! Don´t miss it! Not only does it show beautiful collection of stones, carpets, crystal work, paintings etc, it has a magnificent architecture as seen from the outside.

I would strongly recommend seeing this instead of the city palace! The collection is astounding and covers varios subjects. Ancient metallurgy, pottery, handicrafts, weaving, dyeing & printing of clothes etc etc. It is like, you name it and you have it. There is enough for a specialist as well as the casual, curious or the generalist.... Get a ""composite ticket available for "" 300 which covers this location.

Lots of exhibits, of various categories and from different countries, but nothing interesting at all! City palace has better collection of weaponry and lots of things are in fact replicas (on careful reading of the board under it). Despite being a museum enthusiast, i found... Im not a big lover of museums but this one is worth visiting.
It looks  nice from outside and full of exhibits inside. I love this building, built by Queen Victoria for Prince Albert's visit, and now converted to an Indian and Rajasthani history museum.

We didn't get an audioguide (the foreign visitor's ticket was expensive enough), and the museum is basically not enjoyable at all. Random objects scattered around the place with signs like this: ""Stuff: rare&old"". Probably with an audioguide it makes more sense but I would recommend...

What a beautiful collection . The galleries of... A place where we have lots of items n antiques worth a look. British era building surrounded by lush Ramniwas garden n facing statue of Sawai Man Singh on a horse. 
It's exterior is getting spoiled by the army of birds all over. The Albert Hall Museum also known as Central Museum is located in the Ram Niwas Garden. Uniqueness of the dresses and jewelry of all the classes and tribes of Rajasthani people,Puppets and Phad paintings,Rajasthani music and dance forms gallery, Oldest and finest identified carpets, jewelry,... It is unexpected to find such an array of displays here in Jaipur. This surely shows that the local authorities are interested in educating the local population. There are displays covering Egypt, Mesopotamia, Japan, Turkey, and of course, the local region. Wonderful to see miniature... We've visited on Oct13 and due to the Dusshera celebrations the museum was closed. The architecture is worth seeing.
We really enjoyed the thousands of pigeons there. Our kids really loved the experience. JLN marg, the Qween of royal roads in Jaipur, is flanked on both its ends by some exquisite architectural delights which are not to be missed for their visual and photographic memories.On one end is superbly crafted present day ornamental gate of Jawahar Circle garden... Excellent museum. Wonderful sculpture, great section on miniatures, great section on musical instruments, and an ancient weapon section that is outstanding. Must visit for those who like to know about history. It took me more than three hours to see the museum which has pottery, coins, paintings, swords, shields. The museum has beautiful miniatures of various Yoga asanas. It has beautiful paintings from Japan, India,  Europe... Wonderful museum to visit, only if you are interested in history. There is lots to see and learn, and it may take days if you study and are keen to know the culture of our kings & queens...how they lived. I was surprised to see... While the building this museum resides in is beautiful, the actual museum is very dull, theme-less and of low quality.
The exhibits are very poorly lit and almost no documentation is available to understand what it is you are watching.
It is literally possible to... Superb collection, The building itself is worth a visit! Even the monument itself is an architectural marvel. A nice combination of Indian culture and international arts and crafts. It has a mummy which is very rare to be seen. We enjoyed Albert Hall museum a lot. Although you need to be interested in history otherwise it might bore you. I enjoyed the section where they have a big collection of weapons used during wars many hundreds of years ago Could really do with air con, in 45 degree heat, the standard fans were just pushing around the hot air. Very impressed with the items for view. Visit to Albert Hall museum is on our list of must-do’s in Jaipur. The architecture of the museum is certainly worth admiring and then one can easily spend a lot of time looking at the wall paintings and other collection here. Don’t miss out on... A beautiful building houses this very good museum. Lots of history and artefacts especially from Rajasthan. Also saw a Mummy from Egypt. Nice exhibition of vases, coins, swords, shields and daggers.

Albert hall mueseum is worth visiting. very goog craftmanship on display. even the monument itself is an architectural marvel. certainly a must place to see in jaipur.

it is within city and easily reachable This provided plenty of surprises, especially the huge sitar upstairs. A wander through this shows the opulence of the past. Walking from the Pink City, look for the rats in the nearby park with their tunnels under the trees. I have been to a number of museums in the past and was not expecting much difference at Albert Hall either. However I was pleasantly surprised with the quantity and quality of things on the showcases of the museum.  The blue pottery artifacts are well... Its a British look building. The area outside the  hall is open and posh. We could not see the museum as it was late. Wevhad a look from the outside and it looked grand.I wish we could have visitedcthe museum.However, check the photos I clicked... too many pigeons so making the place unkempt. Nice building from the outside. A lot of small displays but the place could do with some spring in the management to spruce up the place and display. I am totally in love with the design of this building. Situated in the Center of the city with the design as Early British Colonial times. Surrounded by Animal and Bird Zoo. Its a major tourist attraction with the gardens on the side. Here you... No security, no proper exit and entry plan, esp on weekends makes this awesome place, unsafe to visit and just too crowded for us to handle. but a picture with those pigeons outside is a must... near jaipur zoo,you see this meseum,you see rajput kin g's drtesses,weapons,many other valuable things used by rajput kings If you are not a museum fan then you can skip Albert Hall museum and visit other places. After visiting all forts, city palace we decided to go to Albert Hall museum. There are different rooms for different styles of culture but as our group... A learning experience about the diverse history of Jaipur. The building of the museum itself was picturesque as well. Would recommend it to the museum lovers. Likes : Separate room for separate things like guns, clothings used in past, musical instruments, pictures and also for the items that have been imported from other countries.

The mummy kept there attracts special attention though ! I belong to Pink City Jaipur only. This is a must watch in Jaipur . Need to visit this place in the afternoon only to see the museum but the monument looks awesome in the night when all the lights are on. Beautiful
One can... This is an excellent museum with a very good collection of antique items. One can learn a lot about the history from this museum. The maintenance of the museum is also up to the mark. One can have a look at lot of items from... The museum is excellent with very good collection. I enjoyed most sections but the rare coin collection was my favourite. The architecture is also worth a dekko. The over-enthusiastic guards made for a nuisance, spoiling the experience somewhat. They kept blowing a shrill whistle when... The collection is no doubt good but small. The entire trip is over very very soon. Not worth going unless you are passing by from in front of it A lovely place maintained by the government to see some fine architecture, woodwork and various exhibits. You could buy a composite 5 point ticket for Rs 70 here. The arrangement, cleanliness and the collection of this museum is exemplary. A must view place... If you are in Jaipur, just for 2 days then I don't think Albert Museum will fall in your itinerary. I just had 1.5 days to spend and I gave this place a miss. But, I ensured I stopped over for a good photo session.... this was our last palce to visit in jaipur and aptly so. I thanked my travel agent for designing my trip in this way. After seeing the jaipur attractions and everything else for so long, it summed up the history of how jaipur came to... Loved the pigeons and cool lawns where we could sit and relax after a long walk inside the museum
Most parts were blocked off for renovation though This is the place where you can spend hours and days as it has history ranging from caste to pottery and metal work and guns and artilary.. You shall fall in love with the kind of history it has in it. Also you can save... This was a nice but small museum.  They had a nice audio device that you listen too while walking about.  Its worth a visit.  Cheap fee if you ask me. This museum has improved over recent years, great effort has been made to prevent the pigeons spoiling the experience I loved everything about the museum .The exterior displays great architecture range.The exhibits are preserved and displayed properly.The tour through the museum seems like a tour through time. Definitely worth a visit This museum is really really clean, it looks like a museum from the west! A lot to see and a lot to learn. Entrance fee is 150 rupees for overseas visitors and it's open from 9 am to 5.30 pm. One of the interesting attractions we visited during our stay in Jaipur in January was the Government Central Museum, otherwise known as Albert Hall Museum.  This building, along with the nearby Ram Niwas Garden, was once referred to as the 'Pride of the New Jaipur'... The museum is truly worth a visit...also in the evenings the place outside becomes like a picnic spot with locals coming for stroll and fun...Photography is allowed inside the museum This museum was built by the british people when India was under their control, it has many articles and things from the bygone period. Very good artefacts from the 19th century - statutes, pots, coins and currencies, paintings, shields, swords, guns, music instruments and much much more makes this place take you back in time! Some of the artefacts are well preserved. Though the overall maintenance could be better.
The best part is the building itself, and the pigeons make it more attaractive. Good collections of artefacts, however we rushed through most of them since we had a flight to catch to get back home to Mumbai. Also we were there about closing time - another reason for the rush. You need to give at least 2-3 hours... It was a splendid The range of art work was astounding. The knowledge gained was inspiring. The sadness of the level of destruction to monuments and artifacts by invading nations bought tears to my eyes, since i cannot fathom how people could be so destructive... The building behind is Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur, the Pink City. Although the museum has a rich collection of artifacts, you find it interesting only if you re really big fan of museum. I do appreciate a-lot the building itself. Internet shows it is... Albert Hall's architectural beauty alone would be worth the trip.  The museum found within is well done and very interesting.  If I returned to Jaipur with friends, I would definitely take them to the Hall. In a wonderful old building an eclectic array of artifacts are housed in old Victorian-style cabinets. There is an excellent collection of handmade carpets and statues. Across the street is the Zoo where you can see a tiger if you miss them on safari. The building itself is worth a visit! I really liked wandering around looking at the displays but the building itself is the star attraction. It apparently has a huge Persian carpet in it but I was told it is only on display Thursdays. Superb collection from all over of all sorts of things over a long period. U'll need atleast an hour to appreciate all the items on display from weaponry to paintings so take ur time. 

Also they offer a combined ticket for all the major tourist... Visit the museum for some hidden gems like the tiger hunting elephant seat and some amazing weapons. We were a bit rushed by our guide until we told him we liked museums. From outside you can see the current Maharajahs palace - he's only 16... Date of Visit: 25th Mar 2013

Fees: 300 INR for a composite ticket (strongly recommended because it also covers 4 other major attractions - Amber Fort, Nahargarh Fort, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar), 20 INR (parking)

This building is fantastic and the carving beautiful. The outside part is accessible to visitors from the back  door without buying an entrance ticket. Though the entrance ticket gives access to a full collection of artefacts, paintings, writings etc .... The collection is rich and... Most likely building itself is more interesting than the museum. Beware of pigeons. Lots, lots of exhibits inside however not well arranged. The Albert Hall is an impressive building on the outside but what a shame that inside lies a great collection surrounded by dirt and pigeon droppings.  The place hasn't been cleaned for a very long time and staff just don't seem to care which is... Albert Hall is situated in Ramniwas Garden opposite Jaipur Zoo. If you are travelling in Jaipur with tourist guide or any travel agent this will be  the first place to visit during your trip. Always buy a combined ticket for all the monuments (it is...

Excellent place to visit if you are interested in antiques, armory etc... one place in India where a mummy has been kept...

The weapons, war items, dresses etc of the kings are so interesting to see and know about! The museum is hughe and well maintained, however as a foriegner you many like it, but I doubt Indians would find it very amusing.

 level 2: most amazing collection of miniature paintings..learnt a lot about not just painting but also the subjects of... This shabby museum houses the most fabulous collection of archaeology, marble and clay objects, miniature paintings... 
Take your pick. Hardly anybody goes there. A nice place to spend some spare time. Can enjoy even from the outside as the museum is not very impressive.. you will miss only the miniature art work inside. 
The building is an oasis of calm and peace in the middle of a bustling... It's a shame there isn't money or interest to save the art and furniture that will eventually fade with the sunlight pouring onto it. We had some spare time so we went to the museum, it was good way to spend an hour or so.... Beautiful building and definitely worth seeing. There are many pigeons on and in front of the museum. One might say, that there are more pigeons than on San Marco Square, Venice :-)
It's really not worth going inside. The things you see isn't some great... If u r visiting the Albert hall museum then do opt for the audio guide at a nominal cost. It is cleverly designed and simple to use and is extremely useful while visiting the different sections of the museum as it provides a summary of... This is centrally located and very close to famous shopping arena called Bapu Bazar. Collection is good but the only problem here is the parking. Parking is very small hence taken a lot of time. Otherwise its front view is amazing and you can feed... It is a good museum to visit if you have time. Not a mandatory place. There are some pretty good collections here, even a mummy that was brought from Egypt. I found the museum rather tedious and much preferred the Observatory built at the end of the eighteenth century. This is such a beautiful building. The internal layout is wonderful - thoughtful use of open enclosures, internal balconies and corridors. It's just so poorly maintained. Seemed like certain areas were not mopped/cleaned in months. 

Worth a visit if you are in the vicinity -... a place replete with history, great ambience, easy to reach & situated close to the market, zoo. good place to visit at any point of time but should be avoided during afternoon if summers. A glorious Indo-Saracenic monstrosity of 1887, it creates a wonderful skyline.  Personally I could have seen most of what I wanted without the entrance fee, although I liked the poems and quotations in Gothic script in the two courtyards. another great place to tick off from your to do list in jaipur.Right opposite the Zoo and not very far from the other attractions like Hawa Mahal,City Palace and Birla Mandir.Nice display of the weapons,Chinaware and cuttlery and clothes from the Royal collection.This museum is... The structure itself is a wonderful piece of architecture. It's just simply lovely to look at from any  side on the outside. Inside it's interesting and really worth a visit, but not a particularly long one. A good hour or two would do it. The museum has an amazing collection of various items-be it pottery,painting,weapons. The place and the articles are very well maintained. Adjoining gardens are beautiful. The view of the area from is rear end staircase is very lively! This place is definitely a one time visit... This place is soo beautifully built and on top of it we always have 1000's of pigeons. Top priority has to be given to this monument, if you are visiting Jaipur. It was a pleasant afternoon browsing through the nice collection of figures at work and play depicting the lifestyle, costumes and surroundings. There is a good collection of statues and pottery excavated. you must visit this albert museum,,,
It has the Rich wealth of past history items... take atleast 4-5 hours to understand and study the articles.. Great building of hybrid English colonial and Mughal architecture houses an eclectic assortment of sculpture, musical instruments, miniature paintings, etc. The latter is a good selection (certainly not up to par with the National Museum's in Delhi or the stellar works on display at Mehrangarh... The architecture of the museum was beautiful, especially from from the distance, but once inside we were a bit sad to see the conditions in which the building is and especially in which their heritage is stored. You can see some nice pieces, but overall... If you have visited some larger museums in your travels, the contents of this one won’t ‘wow’ you, however, the architecture and local collections are worthy of an hour or so visit.   We made it one of four stops on an afternoon outing with an... Originally that was build by the local king to welcome and Honor King Albert from London who visited the princely state during British Raj.

The  collection of artifacts of olden times takes me to the British India. Museum is very well preserved and even you... It is worth visiting .
It is very clean .
It reminds us of history with the things used at that time The building is lovely and not crowded. The collection is moderately interesting - although the displays of village life are a series of small figures displayed in cases. Still, worth doing if you have time. If you like going to museums and a connoiseur of it, then this is probably the country most well kept and best museums. The collection is abundant and exquisite. The place is really good. People should visit this place during daytime before it is closed. The ground floor of the museum will give you the feel of the jewellery the rajasthan people wear. It gives you the cultural feel of rejasthan. The architecture of... The collection of art from across the globe under one roof is what you get at the Albert Hall Museum. Especially see some of the Indian paintings on the first floor. Good for spending an hour or two, located centrally. The structure is unremarkable in itself but the surroundings are nice. The museum is worth the visit Albert Hall Museum is easily among the most visible and attractive museums in Jaipur. The building is surrounded by beautiful gardens called Ram Niwas Bagh and its easy to find parking here. The building is well maintained and the audio guide is also done well.... Just BEAUTIFUL- I can spend a week there and yet not be able to complete it- They have the most incredible pieces of ancient history of every possible country of the world. its just the  MOST BEAUTIFUL-and above all unlike other countries its ABSOULUTELY FREE... This was by far the biggest disappointment I have met in Jaipur. A mish-mash of history with no formal structure. Exhibits in cases that can't be seen into because of reflections/ Inside the exhibits are dirty. 
If you've ever been to the Cairo Museum and... The mood at this place reminds me of the India of 30 years ago.  The place is architecturally impressive, but the people in ticket line are pushy, the art is displayed hapharzardly without much explanation, and there is no A/C inside.  However, it's worth seeing... The building looks amazing from outside, but the museum inside isn't very well-maintained. It seems repetitive if you've already visited the City Palace Museum. 

My advice would be to skip the museum bit. Just settle yourself on one of the seats in the outside corridor... Nice small museum with a real mummy preserved.
Feed pigeons in the front of the hall.
Do visit the zoo and bird house nearby, within walkin distance. quite disappointing being the central museum in Jaipur. it shows art pieces with descriptions in English, but it's not very interesting at all...
The composite ticket we bought in Amber Fort includes the entrance fee of this museum. To visit Albert Hall early in the morning and see the competing flocks of pigeons swirling through the spires and arches of this delicately proportioned structure is an uplifting experience. However to return later in the day and enter the museum, to find what is... A beautiful colonial style building with a higher quality of Architectural detail and aesthetic appreciation than most of the 'palaces' in India, which are plaster faced monoliths. It has beatiful stonework and arch work plus the ceilings have a quality in their detail. Regrettably the... Museum surely got good collection but can be maintained in better way, less organized and poorly lit up.

This place surely needs your lots of time, situated opposite Jaipur Zoo and less than couple of km from Birla temple so club or plan your visit... Iems are not very well displayed and photos are hard to take through plexiglass. Audio guide was mediocre. However, you cannot come to Jaipur and not see the museum. Some cool art pieces.

Overall about an hour to go through it efficiently. You can buy... In all the places that i visited in Jaipur, i would rate this one as the best. A museum that clearly exhibited the taste and splendour and rich past of India/Rajasthan and if not for my bad planning, i would have easily spent a day... This is a very large museum worth an hour or so of your time.  The building itself is worth the trip and it holds many items of the Indian heritage. Definitely worth the visit.

I cannot really describe in words, there is much and i really like all the artifacts, as i love history.

Spare about 2 hrs time to visit this place thoroughly,located about a Km away from... well the museum is nice n a few things are there too ,also one can sit n relax in the gardens around .so overall good at a low price,convieniently located I did not go inside but the buidling from the outside at sunset is majestic What a piece of construction .Well proportioned and symmetrical front facade.However , could not see much inside.The real attraction lies in the external features. Would suggest to skip this . . . its very small with hardly any thing to reflect the rich rajput heritage. Total waste of time above an hour. visting jaipur and having look to the history is must . albert hall is a place where ancient art lives .it have things used by Kings who ruled Jaipur 250 years back and the beauty is maintained . A Mummy from Misrah can also be... The primary reason to visit this museum is the architecture and the actual building - it is a joy to explore. The statues, artifacts and art are all well worth viewing, though one might wish for better displays, the occasional seating and even some air... If you're in Jaipur and have some leisure time, you can visit this place for about 2 hours. Otherwise, i didn't find anything special or remarkable here. This museum houses some very beautiful pottery and paintings. There is even a mummy. Overall you can see nice things but nothing spectacular. The building on its own is also nice to see. Its the city museum, not much to see inside but its just 10 rs that takes you in and 1 hours to complete the round! but i believe one should not miss it! moreover you don't need to hassle its in the city center next... This is a fascinating building. It is lovely to look at. There are some interesting exhibits but the pigeons are doing untold damage inside and out. Shame. The Museum building is a nice architectural feat in itself. very imposing and beautiful from outside. but that's it. Don't bother going in, all they have on display are skeletons stuffed animals , preserved animals. heck what were you xpecting. Maharajas and their ornate swords... With all the heritage sights in Jaipur, Albert Hall Museum is a little dry with all it's text heavy descriptions of everything that was a part of old world Jaipur.

I do however have to say that some of their displays such as their pottery... I thank the people reponsible for making this a wonderful museum. It is having very good collection of art & history. The Museum is spread in a huge two story building and the painting are articles are worth to see. The major problem is, most of them are not at all maintained properly and need maintenance.

There are thousands of interesting exhibits.If you want to know about India's past and customs this is the place to go.The costumes worn by the old Raj .are fantastic We walked around the outside of the building that is really superb. We did not visit the museum itself as we were running out of time. Such a nice fort to see. Controlled by archeological department. Lots of historical information gathered from there. First, the building itself is splendid and like the V and A designed to represent and house some of the best arts and crafts of the period.  Second, the exhibits are excellent, in particular the ceramics.  Overall the place could do with a bit of...

This is a very good musium that has old artaliries,and war weapons and worth seeing.Mostly skipped by tour operators but definetly worth seeing .Centrally located and takes abut an hour This is the biggest museum in Jaipur and houses a pretty large collection. All the major artifacts which were excavated in the near vicinity of Jaipur are on display here. The museum has more than 10 galleries like stone sculptures, textiles, miniature paintings, porcelain, carpets,... Similar to the city place museum plus few items brought in from foreign lands. Buy a combo ticket to see Amber /Amer palace, Albert hall, jantar mantar, nagargarh fort and hawa mahal. The replacement of human guide by a radio guide is a great idea. it is also implemented well. Iwould like to see the system in all historical tourist centers in Maharashtra The building alone is worth seeing from the outside. Inside the contents are a bit like our V&A in London: there is a very interesting collection of ceramics on the ground floor and fine Indian miniature paintings upstairs. Also fascinating lifelike figurines of workers in... The collection is not very extensive compared to Western museums, and the building is run-down and dirty thanks to the thousands of pigeons hanging around.

I'm not really into museums much but this one was very nice - lovely building and lots of interesting things to see inside. However it took us ages to find the way out  - it's like a maze in there - heaven help anyone caught... This old and famous museum was modeled on the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Its collection includes portraits of local kings, costumes, woodcarvings, paintings, and arts and crafts. It si sad that photography isnt allowed. anyhow, the moments spent together are memorable...for ever!! This museum is far from satisfactory. It appears that the tourism department did not know what to do with this beautiful building, so they decided to convert it into a museum. The displays and the write-ups are very poorly coordinated This large English looking Palace has been converted to the Jaipur Museum and contains many important displays including ancient Indian sculptures and even ancient Egyptian sculptures. There are artworks, ceramics, and mnay crafts. The building itself is well woth a visit. Comprehensive exhibits of pottery from all over India, as well as some choice stone carving and interesting textiles. Also many miniature paintings, but not the variety and quality of the National Museum in New Delhi. If you want to see how a museum looked in 1869 , this is the place! much more beautiful on the outside than the inside, but worth a quick visit.good ""green"" cafe by the entrance, clean loos, and lots of pigeons! consists of old statues and weapons which was used during the mughel time , good for school going children who wants to learn about history.

Learn about ancient warfare and sculptures. It also houses a library. A small museum compared to some others in India. The collection is good - specifically the coins, miniature paintings and pottery.

There is an Egyptian Mummy also on display.

Being the National Museum day on 18th May, the entry was free to the museum and... europe style xviii/xix style , interesting,but similar plenty at europe, so visit just to see , what is from UK is a heritage for India. just a 90 minuts see. For me it was interesting,but plenty tourist were borimng ,and going out after 20 minuts. Excellent small museum type place to visit. My wife and I spent about 2 hours at this place. There are a lot of paintings, sculptures, and very unique pieces. You do not need any audio guide because everything is written. one of the most picturesque locations of jaipur which boasts of beauty, splendor and loads of old world charm... the building in itself is very imposing surrounded by large gardens on all sides giving a tranquil setting to it....
The display is amazing including the... Quite of stuff. Interesting manustcrits, pottery, instruments and so on. Would have expected to see more of furniture, carpets, textiles and jewlery. you need approx 1h. nice place to visit ,definetly recomend this museum Here you can see old weapons of the royal age - 17th century, pieces of sculpture, paintings, dummies of mummies, amazing locks, items made of brass, and many guns of old times. The guns are the ones that are very special. Go to the Amber and City fort instead. The Hawa Mahal is a must. Jantar Mantar and Jall Mahal if you can. Try and use the pre recorded audio systems rather than the human guides at these sites. Sadly the audio is much better and... This beautiful and impressive building was constructed somewhere in the year 1876. It is situated in a very sprawling garden in the heart of the Pink City. You can see in this museum finest of sculptures, paintings, various types of decorated utensils , Egyptian Mummy,... Fantastic mementos, what was surprising was there was an egyptian mummy there. I love that someone had the passion to try to preserve and bring in art.  Unfortunately, I went there alone (I'm female) and felt the constant attention of the young men walking around...a little distracting.  There were some interesting artifacts, the audio tour wasn't bad,... Albert hall museum is another picturesque site in the city.. It is located very near to the main Bapu Bazaar market of Jaipur.. The places around Albert Hall are only at walk able distance.. Recently opened ""Down To Earth"" cafe - an organic food outlet... a very good collection of object worth the time and money........................................................................................................................................ I was amazed by the sheer size and beauty of this museum. It looks just like a palace from outside. The view is far more better at night with the lighting effects.
Inside, the museum has a rich collection of artefacts like paintings, carpets, ivory,... This is a very beautiful architecture & the museum has really very rare articles collection. there is a nominal entrance fee. One can buy composite ticket at just Rs.50 (indian nationals) which includes entry for 5 monuments - Amber Fort, Albert Hall, jantar mantar, Nahargarh... Great building and beautiful collection. Very worthwile to visit. Use audio-guide (value for money) The building is attractive. There is a worthwhile audio tour (included in the foreigners' entrance price). Murals on the outside are interesting. The collection is actually more interesting than that in the National Museum in New Delhi. Dingy, musty, cluttered and a total waste of money -- it's a pity that the artefacts on display did not have sufficient information about them and were randomly arranged.

We noticed many items of note lying in non-descript corners of the building and, there were... I found this very interesting to visit, aged 47. My 11yr old stone was not so convinced although some aspect interested him. I would allow yourself plenty of time here if like me it interest you.

Jaipur has plenty to offer and the two day... Even if you don't spend much time looking at the exhibits, the building which houses the museum is worth a visit. Audio guide is worth the expense. Again my driver just stopped so I could take photos. I wish I had taken the time to in this museum is much bigger then all of the other museums in Rajasthan , takes a long time to see things and if you have a guide then he will have much interesting stories to tell you. You can also see the zoo when you... A grand relic of past times it is located at on a round about.  Our guide advised that we would get most from a drive past but it could be worth a detailed visit if you have time it stannd great and grant in the heart of the pink city. we fell in love with the winding arches and the remains of old artifacts. felt god to feed the pigeons outside.strangely peaceful. Badly maintained museum with mix use of architectural style. I was really impressed with what this had to offer.  Folks told me about the mummy (which IMHO wasn't the best attraction).  I was more impressed by their collection of old coins - some ranging back to almost 1000yrs ago!  Also their collection of guns,... Really great collection of many types of articles.

Take Camera and take lots and lots of pics.

Extra ordinary collection of textiles, armours, weapons, life style sculpturs, coins, etc.,

All other museums are pale in comparision to this one. We only had an hour to visit this museum, and wished we had a lot more time.  Some other reviewers have implied that this museum is somewhat fuddy duddy, but we thought it was excellent.  When we visited Jaipur we only had time for the... Probably the best museum in Jaipur you can find. The building itself ins really beautiful. Best way to get around would be with a Audio-Tour-Guide, which is available near the ticket counter. It will explain you almost 30 most important exhibits inside the museum. Also... As an indian , its nothing spectacular, good for school going kids. We enjoyed wandering through the dated yet fascinating exhibits. A nice combination of Indian culture and international arts and crafts. The building itself is something to explore and the murals in the outside courtyard were especially interesting to see. We though Albert Hall was interesting but not a necessary stop on our tour. As mentioned in another review, buy the combination ticket at one of the forts or at Jantar Mantar before coming here since it will save you money. 

My husband liked the... they got good collection of every thing but space is very less and moreover was very much over crowded and i felt like more things needed to be displayed there ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Excellent hall with beautiful carvings, Mummy is famous artifact to look, other things are also very beautiful. Lonely Planet is not nice to Albert Hall. Most people visit Amber Fort, and there you can get a 300 rs ticket including Jantar Mantar, Nahargarh fort, Hawa Mahal, Albert Hall and Amber.
 Real bargain, and Albert Hall has its nice moments, all though not... I visit Albert hall recently in december 2010, to celebrate NEW YEAR and to know more about JAIPUR.. This perticular hall was my first site scene.. This hall describes us about the rule of kings in jaipur and the things used by them...
Them most... INCREDIBLE building and collection of paintings, bronzes, fabrics, coins/money, etc.   What a jewel!   The restaurant on the  premises is also good, clean-- and fully organic. Now a museum.  I used the recorded guide which was worth it.  Spent a long time here.  Busy but interesting.  It was nice to find somewhere cool to site and just watch people.  History very interesting.  Definitely worth a visit if you like architecture.  Pigeons... Albert Hall Museum is oneof the Jaipur's best kept secrets and its all thanks to Lonely planet guide, which describes the Albert museum as a place not worth visiting. It is wrong. Musuem has great collection of thnigs to see, even an Egyptian mummy :).... It was summers of 1999 and when I visited Jaipur for the first time,I  was pretty excited.The first thing that I saw was Albert Hall Museum and it completely sucked........Lonely Planet guys were right about the museum.So after that I went to jaipur 2 more... Was excited when someone told me that there is Mummy in the museum! The museum will take you back ages in Indian History. Coins, Guns, Swords, Attire are all there! And there is this cafe in the museum premises. Try that as well. 
Approx time... First of all, for any Lonely Planet readers, the guidebook is totally off on this one. The museum is not dusty nor are the exhibits careless---quite the opposite on both fronts (I think they did major renovations a few years back).

The museum is on... Go for this if you have spare time in your trip..The collection is decent, I particularly liked the frescoes on the lower floors. This museum boasts of an egyptian mummy as well, something which I haven not seen in a museum in India. Take the... The antiquity collection is interesting and notes well researched. their seems to be a shortage of space in some areas. The layout is little confusing and navigation not well designed . If you are not careful you may miss some parts. Textile  & sculpture diaplay... I had opportunity to visit this museum along with my family during my trip to Jaipur.

This is really a place one should not miss to see . The time should be spend minimum 4 to 5 hours to see all the sections carefully. We visited by tuk-tuk and enjoyed the history and architecture of the building and local road/garden layout.  The collection is unique if a bit dusty but we were mobbed by friendly schoolchildren so missed quite a lot of content. I was not hoping for any pleasure from visit to the museum but surprisingly the museum had more than it promised to be. It had artifacts from all over the world, including an Egyptian mummy. It would take you 2-3 hours to go through the... you can see the whole of jaipur from the top of this palace.you will love it and try the local food here.its royal. A mini taste of Indian culture, though the display lacked adequate descriptions on the history of the pieces. More really for viewing rather than learning. Good museum and audio tour highlighted best items.  But it was very crowded and noisy, even the staff were loud with lots of whistle blowing and shouting. After visiting so many palaces it was nice for a change of pace and to look at a bit of history on display not just buildings. This museum is in City and has good collection of items used by Rajas and Paintings etc Jaipur is the best place I have ever visited.
In Jaipur, I saw Albert Hall Museum, City Palace, Haldi Ghati, Ghasiyar, Maharana Pratap Museum, Hawa mahal, Jantar Mantar, Birla temple, Gaitor etc.

Jaipur,Jaipur Wax Museum,"Its a good museum to visit if you have 1-2 hours to spare and haven't been to other wax museums before. If you have time to spare then this place could be added to your visiting list when you're in Jaipur. It will take 1.5 hrs to fully see this attraction. Nice place .
But wax statues are of much low quality as compared to the madam Tussad and also they are of limited numbers . On top of that you are not allowed to take pictures on your own when you have already paid the... It is addjoing to Nahargarh fort,near amber fort.it is about 8 km from Jaipur.

A peaceful place where can experience something historic and know about Jaipur as well that makes us feels hopeful and lovely at Jaipur This place is a must for the visitor to Jaipur. It is located at the top of the hill, which is the highest point in Jaipur.  The museum is very much comparable to Madam tussads.  The wax replicas are placed in line as per history.... Worth visiting place to see at Jaipur.The place on the top of hill and a beautiful place with clean surrounding . The ticket price is pretty steep at Rs 500 per person, and it is for both Wax Museum and the adjoining Sheesh Mahal.

Wax museum is divided into two parts: first part containing wax statues of Indian and International celebrities and the second containing statues... One of the best place to visit in jaipur. The museum has all type of ideols one wants to see. Once to visit if you are in jaipur This place though not much highlighted, but is a delight and is perfect place to visit with kids!
On top of it they have reasonable photographer who will take your photos and than share it in pen drive...
Good place! After the Nahargarh Fort visit, the tourists normally head towards the recently constructed Wax Museum and the modern Sheesh Mahal. Around 15 Indian wax statues and 9 international artists including Michael Jackson as well as the Spider Man are on display with imagined setting. The... A trip to Jaipur is incomplete without visiting the Jaipur Wax Museum. The museum holds beautiful wax statues and wax sculptures. The guide explained us well about the museum and the experience was worth it. Awesome feeling 
Tremendous work of glass in SHEESH MAHAL
Guide's are also good in explaining about everything in wax museum. It is a good place to visit but there are few things that are not good.

Not very big, you cannot click pictures.

They will provide you a photographer he will click for you & later on you have to buy the soft copies. Situated on the Hill Top Nahargarh, the entry fee is 500 rs.  For Wax Museum and Sheesh Mahal. 
The wax museum 1 doesn't offer anything new for people seen Madame Tussauds and as photography is not allowed gets over within 10 minutes as it is... This wax museum is so small around 10 to 15 wax idols are there. And Ticket of this museum is so high.. so if you want to try for the first time in life then it is OK.. Also there they are charging for taking... This place is a must visit. It gives a glimpse of the Wax museum Madame Tussauds. It covers the Indian icons. Though the area covered is small but still I must say that kids love to watch and pose for photographs with the icons.  The... This is kind of a tourist trap. The place has some nice wax statues but is quite small when compared to Madam Tussauds. Awesome place to enjoy with family and friends. They have limited exhibits but it's definitely work in progress. The highlights are definitely the Royal Darbar and the Sheesh Mahal, both of these are very unique and creative. Met the owner Rajiv Kohli, a very friendly... Pity it was very small, covering not so many characters.
Worth visiting though, especially for the attached sheesh mahal display that you can only see in pictures.
a wonderful experience. As its name you can imagine what is inside, have wax statues of famous person, there is an entry fee too but you can visit once if you feel. Don’t understand why there is so little emphasis on projecting well known personalities of Rajasthan such as painters, musicians etc.. It is located at Nahargarh fort... to enter wax museum one needs to pay extra, if I remember correctly around Rs 400 per person... which is way expensive...

Good place, but not worth the price... Located near the nahargarh fort this is a small museum of wax having statues of famous celibrities and great people... nice collection and is a great place to roam around with kids... Its not worth the price
Few Exhibits
You cannot take picture and the statues are not life like
I paid around 450 PP for sheesh mahal and this I went to the Jaipur Wax Museum and the Sheesh Mahal inside the Nahargarh Fort.  It's run as a separate museum, so you have to pay an extra entrance fee to enter.  It is pretty expensive for India prices and my guide told me not... Great trip unforgettable moments for children and staff members great hospitality great service greattrip It may be worth a visit for people who have not seen Madam Tussade's wax museum anywhere. It was a big disappointment. Statues were like mere models - not life size. Very few wax statues. Seesh Mahal was relatively better but not that great. Overall... Awesome Place............a must visit, Sheesh Mahal itself it a wonder. Very hygienic culture, Staff was Polite, well maintained property Amazing place with a bunch of wax statue of famous personalities. Not a big museum. Number of Statue are less. Photography is not allowed. Charges for photography is quite expensive. I am expecting more than this. But Overall Experience is Good. Literally waste of money..nothing major to see except sheesh mahal and overly exaggerated..asked to wear show covers for a completly dusty place Awsome place, definately worth for money, Words cant explain the majestic beauty of sheeshmehal, i was not expecting the place will be that good.Best customer services, thank you Piyush Bhargava for giving me time and giving information about the statues Been to wax museum recently, was a mind boggling experience,
It's a must watch , when ur in Jaipur.
Do watch sheesh mahal it wud be great experience overall !!! It's a beautiful place. Each statue is so real, love the royal darbar and sheesh mahal is amazing. I suggest each and every tourist in Jaipur to go to Jaipur Wax Museum. It is must visit place. It was one of a kind experience for me. Each and every statue was breathtaking. Rajamata statue was mesmerizing. 
I was speechless for sheeshmahal the moment i entered there. I suggest this  place to everyone. As our Diwali vacations memories,as we make our plan to visit wax museum at nahargar fort. My family made such plan. My son feeling very excited and of course something will be last for ever till end of the trip because after you see it... We have visited  jaipur wax museum with my wife and son...it's mind blowing  experience. ..all wax statues  are awesome especially  statue of kalam sahab and amitabh Bach chn alongwith  all royal  personalities  of royal  rajputana...
And when we entered  in the  huge  sheeshmahal. ..we all...

The sheesh Mahal was the most unique part of the Museum which matches the... WOW.... awesome place to go with family and friends....all the status are looking real and sheesh mahal is breath taking i loved it.
People who have not seen yet Jaipur Wax Museum. They might miss something in their life. Please go and watch the experience... Osum place just too good to be true!!  The place is brilliantly managed!!  Loved the management and the way they brief you on entry for a smooth tour!!  She's Mahal is an out of the world experience!!! You must visit here for sure!! Overrated wax museum and Shesh mahal. Ticket is a rip off  at Rs. 500 and for every photo they charge Rs. 25

Shesh mahal is nothing in front of Amber and City Palace Shesh mahals.

No pics as I learnt of the con after buying... Amazing, unbelievable that places like these exist  definitely worth a visit if in the area. Must see Came here with mon, dad & wife and paid like Rs 500 per person, ticket. + Rs 50 per person to just enter the Nahargarh Area. So, one might say that the entry fees is a bit higher, which is but its worth paying, because... A very small wax museum. There is no novelty. The statues are not at all attractive. The cost of  entry ticket is on the higher side. Photography is at a cost. Just 15 to 25 min is enough to visit it.  can be avoided. I visited there last summer i.e. in august, 2018. This is very nice place to visit with your child and family. Had great time visiting the best museum every. Must see if you go to Jaipur. Very well managed by Anoopji and his team.

This museum of Jaipur is very good.Its describe our Indian and Rajasthan old historical heritages very well. In this museum we can study the historical behavior of past time people, their standard of life, old currency they used. This museum is full of antics pics... It is situated in Nahargarh Fort. At the entrance of museum there is beautiful 10 feet long Gati Gamini bullet. There are beautiful wax and silicon statues of history, cinema, literature  and sports celebrities like Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, Rajnikanth, Amitabh Bachhan, Albert Einstein, etc....

A short novel experience in an otherwise historical city of monuments.

Jaipur wax Museum is located inside Nahargarh fort.  There is separate ticket of Rs. 350 to visit this place.  Or a combo of Rs. 500 with Sheesh Mahal.  That will be separate from Fort ticket. Was statue of various famous personalities such as Amitabh, Sachin,... Nice place but management over charging fees also way to Nahargarh was also expensive. Its attached to Nahargarh Fort.
This place near to entry gate of Nahargarh. This place is located near the Nahargarh fort. This is a good place to visit if you have kids. Some of the wax statues look real and worth taking pictures. But not the best place to spend time if you are short of time. Good place to see when you visit Nahargarh fort . kids will love it . Don't fall for the combo ticket with seeshmahal  which is also owned and run by the same mgmt - there is nothing interesting in Seeshmahal and the staff inside are... This place is inside Nahargarh Fort. A bit overpriced as it costs 500 p.p.   To see wax museum and sheesh mahal both. Moreover you can not take photos inside the museum. You have to pay to take photos as well

Wax statues of Indian celebrities... We bought 5 tickets from near by . Bought the vouchers still management dint allowed us to enter .

I have never seen museum like this. this place is situated on top of nahargarh fort.. although its tough to get there even by auto. as most drivers dont go there on regular fares its worth the time and money u spend.. tickets are 500 rs per person for both wax museum... The wax museum is definitely a good place to visit to see the wax statues. They have tried to create a good show for each celebrity in it. i just heard about wax statue in different countries, first time we have seen different celebrity wax. this place i havent heard, if our driver never told about the place. thanks to him to brought us here, otherwise we missed it. excellent frame work statue. It's really awesome place where I found everything very real in wax statue, it's really great and awesome place i have been to jaipur a lot of times, and this time i got to know that there is a wax museum in nahargarh fort. so i decided to step my foot there. the entry is nice with a old cindrella style cart for  purchasing... If you want to see effigy of actor and famous person then this is one of the best place in India.Only problem is high ticket cost It's a great initiative. There are about 15 wax statutes in the museum so far .A disappointment for photo fanatics as one is not allowed to take photos inside.while only their photographers take photos which can to buy later. Oh what an experience!! I seriously fell in love with the way this museum has been conceptualised!! Amazing is just a very very simple word to tell you how wonderful it was!! A promise to myself that whenever I m in Pink City I have... This place has around 15 statues and ticket price is Rs.250/- per person.

These statues are kept very neat and clean, all the visitors are given shoe cover to wear over shoes. this place does not allow you to use your own camera. However you... If you want to see effigy of actor , it is made up of wax but looks like original people. it is good to go there They have done a great work in making this.  Good efforts eventhough some statues like Sachin's are not good.  Ticket costs a lot & none is allowed to take photos.  Only their photographers take photos which you need to buy later. This is a sheer waste of money. only few wax statues are there. Rs.500 per person ticket is too costly to see this. this is at Nahargarh Fort We really enjoy the museum. We went there before inauguration that time many statues were in final touch but even then they are looking so beautiful. The most realistic statue was Einstein statue at the entrance. I visited this place with my friends and trust me guys I was surprised to see the level of museum they have made. It is really like watching a international museum with wow statues and the bestest part was the sheesh mahal it truly looks... It is indeed a life time experience to be there at Jaipur Wax Mesuem.

Sheesh mahal is never seen place on earth.
Wax statues are incredibly  realistic. It is located in the nahargarh fort. Excellent work of wax. More than thirty celebrity and great personality had been portrait with wax, which seems to be alive. We purchase dual tickets for sheesh mahal and wax museum it was around 400 per person. If... Located inside Nahargarh fort this place is good to visit. Very interesting. However a tad expensive at Rs 500 per person They sell the tickets to the wax museum and the mirror room in combo . Ticket cost is 500/
Wat you get :
1  wax museum: two corridors filled with a total of about 10 statue s . The quality of the wax statue is... Wax museum is an extra ordinary place to see the statues of great national & international personalities. Great artistic work Finally something new place to visit in jaipur but the challenge is how they will engage users as right now it seems one time place only.
Overcharge in terms of pictures by private company I was dubious about paying for this unexpected extra attraction at nara garth fort but it was worth it. They have created something interesting and artistic here. One of the owners gave us a very enthusiastic tour Jaipur wax museum is fantastic  spot for families and every age group I am visiting Jaipur but only one Jaipur wax museum and his sheesh Mahal I am seen  I feel  I visit world tour  what a great work they do and sheesh Mahal like... Place is good but not worth the money they charge. For indians and.especially srudents the price should.be less. This place has the Wax Statues of some of the Great Personalities. However it is overpriced and you need more time to visit. The place is okay to visit. They charge 250 per head. Wax statues are not so great. Sachin statue is ver poor. 

400 Rs ticket will take you to Sheesh Mahal. 

Low point is Photography not allowed inside. Had they allowed photography inside, one would... It was our first time that we visited this museum. It was in of the must see places of Jaipur. There were a lot of famous man and seems like we saw them in real. It was amazing. An important addition to the must visit sites of Jaipur. Statues are so realistic, Bhagat Singh, Dalai Lama, Dr. Kalam stand out for there details. No need to visit madam tussauds if you have visited this one. Sheesh mahal was magnificent too. Very friendly staff.... The Museum is a wonderful place to visit; has some wonderful wax statues of freedom-fighters, sportsmen, politicians and pop-icons; all are very realistically made, very aesthetically placed in customised theme for each, thus creating an ambience worthy of the statue. 

Within the museum, you can... Best blend of blend of Rajasthan royalty and wax technology. Amazing place wid real celebrities feeling. An amazing visit to the place where wax statues were more realistic than the real celebrities. This place is soooo amazing. The statues were really good and well maintained..few of them I didn't find in other wax museums. All well crafted and almost real..just loved it and look forward to have more statues in future � IT IS VERY NICE PLACE . FORTH IS AWESOME. WAX museum is ultimate . Staff was soo cooperative .

Memorable.. Excellent presentation.. Neat. Clean. Perfect ambience.. The best museum I ever visited. Great work done. Sheeshmahal. Waah Waah. The museum is inside the Nahagarh Fort. Compared to other attractions in Jaipur, this will be a big more costly. Fort Entrance cost and then to the Museum itself also. The collections in small but good. Kids will have a great fun inside and also... This is located at the Nahargarh fort. The entry ticket of Wax museum and Sheesh Mahal is in combined package. You can see the statues of wax of famous celebrities. This is  well maintained place, but is a bit out of place with the overall flavor of the city. A good place for a quick visit. Jaipur wax Museum is a must visit place in Jaipur. It will take away all your exhaustion and tireness in few seconds. Such beautifully designed and maintained place in Jaipur. Yes, there is nothing much to see in this place the only wax museum and Sheesh Mahal entry fee is bit high, but it is worth inside the palace there is nothing much to see It was an amazing place..sheesh mahal is extremely beautiful..nd the staff is  very cooperative and are very helpful... I have never seen before

A must visit if you are travelling to Jaipur, clean zoo situated inside Ramniwas Garden. Do make sure to reach at the zoo opening time as the animals tend to go back n their enclosures once it gets too hot.

Other high points could be healthy cheetals, deers and some of the birds. Lastly, there is a joke... Wasn't hoping for anything great and didnt get it either. Like all the other zoo in the country and has nothing special to offer. Best avoided in summers and can be a great picnic spot for winters. I showed up with three excited children in tow only to be greatly disappointed by unexpected closure.  No signs indicated why they were closed.  It was not their regularly scheduled closure.  I would have been less disappointed if there was some sort of sign that... Very well kept. Hardly any stink like many others I have visited.
Lot of blackbucks, ghariyals, tigers to see. My little one was very excited and happy. They can come up with some refreshment zone. This is the best place for children to visit.

I got disappointed to see its condition.
It is not maintained properly & you can not stay there more than 10 minutes. Jaipur beautiful city ie pink city ,historic also. Hal mahal , hawa mahal jantar mantar are the main attraction . Jaipur zoo also next attraction but it is unmanaged and all animals are in critical condition .should improve lots of things . what a  waste of govt resources. very expensive unit of land and totally ignored...animals were in terrible condition. this was a OK place for young childrens but rajasthan govt. should do more for betterment of animal condition jaipur zoo is very nice and there are number  of animals , quite knowledgeable if you are traveling with kids .you see tiger,lion,deer,so other animals,you sea peacock,white peacock ,you see ostrich,various types of animals & birds. you see tiger,lion,deer,so other animals,you sea peacock,white peacock ,you see ostrich,various types of animals & birds I am not a fan of zoos but visited to kill some time and keep my young daughter entertained.

Of course, a zoo is not the best storage for animals, but I think more so than anywhere else. The prices are normal. The garden was not very clean . Ramniwas bag is situated in mid of the city.

U can't go inside..  u have watch it from road. Click few pictures if u are interested else u can skin this.  U can watch this from taxi also..  No need to get down Visit this place for some open breeze! A nice view, a little street side food, a couple of pictures here and there!! Best time to visit is during evening! A palace in water. That's the only thing I can tell about this place. You can not visit the inside, but it's pretty beautiful from the street nearby. A place to take some pictures of and leave after 3min. I have read many articles on Jaipur and sites like Jal Mahal, but did not expect how much fun this area would be. The floating palace is lovely and the locals and tourists feeding the ducks and cows, selling their local goods and hanging out... Go here in early morning to get a spectacular view of the Sunrise. Can spend good time in Eve. Get clicked in Rajasthan traditional clothes. It is a good place but not well maintained.
the surrounding is very good and quite,
good place to chill for some time. The Jal Mahal is a beautiful palace in the middle of the Mansagar lake. It is only a view stoppage as people are no longer allowed to visit the palace since the construction has become weak over the years. Never the less, a good spot... This place was amazing. If you got try to hook up with Rashid, Agra tours on Facebook as the guy is amazing!? We were at Trident ( just opposite to Jal Mahal) and staying at a lake view room. So we got to see this monument at different times [Sunrise, early morning while it rained and during night under lights].

Also too many irritating sellers ruins that area.. One of the beautiful fort you will witness in Jaipur. But you can see it from the roadside only. Lush of greenery, beautiful lake view around this fort makes it worth to halt for some time here on your Jaipur trip. Saw the Jal Mahal in passing on our way to Amer fort. Nestled in the lake it is a sight to behold. Crowds of tourists and vendors selling their wares and food throng the surrounding area. Looks very pretty. Do a image search on google for Jal mahal. That's the only view you will see in actual. Boating is prohibited and you can't visit inside. Take a mandatory click from road side and tick mark this place from your bucket list! I was saw intrigued to see the Jal Mahal (Water Palace). Especially if you go early in the morning or late afternoon- it looks so pristine. Such a beautiful architecture done in the middle of the lake and surprisingly Jal Mahal has a roof top... A must see in Jaipur, but as always let down by the high amounts of pollution and dirt in the surrounding area. 

Either way, worth a visit!

Ps bring your own bread to feed to the wildlife or buy from the vendors on site Old fort in centre of lake, Jal Mahal meaning palace in water. Good view with parking facility and must visit early morning to avoid street sellers or evening to have a different view. It will not take much time to see around. Area surrounding is...

It's on the way to the amer fort so one can stop... A palace in the middle of the lake - worth stopping for 10 minutes en-route to the Amber Fort. We visited in high summer and the water level was low. Nothing great. Not allowed to go inside. A good view after dark when it it lit. Street shopping can be done here. Watch it on the way after returning back from Amer garh sound and light show On the way to Amber Palace you'll see the Water Palace on your right. Have a stop and look when you return. You only need 10 minutes, but definitely worth it.

The man made lake houses this spectacular Palace which was only used for parties... Once you visit Amer/Jaigarh fort, when you come back, you can see this palace on water on the left. There is no parking available, so better you have your vehicle parked at the pertol pump and you can watch the palace peacefully. There are lot... It is ONE of the important spot TO be visited .good to see nature, children playing around and lots of birds. In March, my husband and I visited India for two weeks with Magic Tours of India. We visited Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, Ranakpur and one day in Narlai. We had custom designed our tour and it covered all of the things we wanted to see... We liked very much the area where Water Place is located. There is a large boardwalk to take a ride by foot, many artigians selling souvenirs and you can see the Water Palace faraway inside the lake and take pictures only from outside. Great place to take a photo 
Makes you think how the other half lived hundreds of years ago 
Very impressive It is incredibly beautiful but the sitting area at the bank stinks. Apart from this it is a nice place to spend some time. Peaceful fort in a jheel , around 15 minutes from my hotel , if you don't go there , there isn't much thay you would miss.

It is beautiful, but you can not go inside, but still worth to see.

The area was bustling with vendors selling street food and trinkets. 
I was able to link this into visiting some... I visited this place in evening and the fort was lit up and was looking really nice in the middle of lake. It was amazing visiting Jal Mahal in Rainy season.
Everyone must visit in Rainy season.
It's highly recommend for newly Wed couple. Jal means water and Mahal means a palace. So, as the name suggests, JALMAHAL is a lake within which a beautiful palace is built. While iets history can be googled, here in few lines I will mention why it attracts tourists. 
    First, it's on old... It was a rather short visit rather to take a click from the road. Its not allowed to enter inside so we decided not to even take the boat ride rather take a shot from the water body. A nice experience, overall. It looks great from a  distance ...the surrondings has a great scope for improvement which can give it a awesome look. You can only take photos. You can’t go out to the palace or in the lake. Would love to be able to out to it and inside. Worth seeing for sure. Just disappointed I couldn’t actually visit. Jalmahal has beautiful view just for photo clicking. It's four floors r deeped in sea. Night amazing view with evng footpath stalls to purchase at low rates. Cannot go by water till Jalmahal as govt as stopped. This trip was really very good.  My love was really very happy. This place choice was my wife. It's nice place. Another amazing structure of Jaipur built in the middle of a lake. The place can be accessed only by boat but currently not allowed to reach there. Hence you have to see from the edge of the lake only. However its a nice treat  the... just be there by evening to get fresh air breeze. Amazing place between water. There is small chowpati & camel cart Jal Mahal sits out in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. Nice place to stop over for a few minutes if you are visiting the amber fort. Entry is not allowed inside the mahal. Worth a quick stop. Good for a photo stop on your way to or from the Ajmer fort. Not really more to add here. Watch out for locals wanting to earn some rupees for a picture with them. A nice place to visit JAL MAHAL or water fort. It is also one of the main tourist spots close to Hawa Mahal and Amber Fort. You can get camel rides here for the kids. It seems to be an important tourist attraction in Jaipur. But all you can see is- a mahal from the shore. Not opened to public but a mahal in the middle of the lake. No parking or entry fee. 15 minutes is sufficient to witness! Lovely palace between water. There is having a boardwalk to see the palace.

The view is mesmerizing.The vibes are energetic. Totally romantic aura around. Great building on the lake in Jaipur with nice photo opportunity as one can't get to the site. Worth a quick stop. Way to stinky and dirty that it used to be few years back. You cannot go anywhere near Lake. Erickshaw can bring this place to stand still at any time. We did not realise that you can only view from across the water and cannot visit , believe that a lot of money is being pumped in by UNESCO to
Jaipur and a restaurant will be developed so you can actually visit ! Seems that there is not the opportunity to go out to the palace, but only to photograph it apparently floating on the lake. Pretty enough, but a shame one can't get a closer look. This place was on my to do list in Jaipur, however was sorely disappointed by the fact that entry is prohibited inside the JAL Mahal. The palace is surrounded by water from all sides so whatever you see from the lake shore is what you... Another attraction that is only for seeing, enjoying and photographing. The Jal Mahal is a place of beauty that cannot be visited.
At night it is illumunated, and even more spectacular It's okay if passing for a quick photo. 
The lake (especially where you stand for the photos (by the shore), is kind of gross. Litter etc. Doesnt seem like you can get out there to look at the actual building. So it's really a photo...

Only you can roam around the lake and spend money on photography. Since visit to Jal Mahal is not allowed, it should not be shown as a place of visit for tourists.

I wouldn’t say this place is a must but do visit it. However be prepared of people trying to sell you something every second. Very busy place and a lot hustle and bustle. The water was suuuper dirty with dead bird and i'm not even talking about the smell! Full of people trying to sell you things, the temple is super far and you see absolutly nothing. I've stay 2 min and go back. Super far from everythings... Another worthwhile building to see in the kaleidoscope of what India is.
Their monuments from the Mogul Empire live on to the present day.

You can't even say you visited it since you can take only photos from the lake shore. It is definitely ok to miss ""attraction"".

The construction is amazing as the water around and underneath the building is used to cool... It’s beautiful and looks the best in evenings since it is lit up, also on the side there a nice market to shop for knick knacks.

Magnificent rooms and a true sense of harmony and peace in every corner of this gloriously restful hotel. Jal Mahal provides a picturesque view during full moon evening, The place is not accessible since it is in the middle of the water. Unbelievable monument. Just fantastic. Thinking that how people built this structure in olden days. Wow Even though the food is good but the service doesn’t match. The non veg is just not good but veg food is fab.

We only got to see this from mile away.
We were told corporate is in process of acquiring property and making it a hotel. 

Congrats to them 

 Corporate greed This palace does not have public entry but one can see it forma distance. The palace is drinking slowly inside the lake. This place is a classic example of people and government doing their best to make a garbage pile out of a historical monument. We do not deserve this piece of history.

But on the whole it is awesome closed for public entrance.You can have a distant view of this partly submerged architecture from a distance.

Jal mahal is called jal because it is having water in hindi jal on all side and mahal is at center of the water beautiful view to see Jal Mahel is not a big place to visit. just a mahal made in between water. but the architecture of this mahel is good. on the bank of this jal mahel there is so many things to purchase like clothes, jewellery etc with low budget...

Stopped off for some photos of Jal Mahal and the wildlife, great architecture. Make sure you keep away from the part where the water/drains flow into the lake. Great views of the Pelicans.

The small chowpati sort of feeling, with good bargain stalls to buy traditional stuff. It's a historical place in Jaipur. It's nice to see in sun set time.  In night time it looks so beautiful This was an excellent place to chill out and enjoy the beauty of JalMahal. It gives you a feeling of how old emperor used to enjoy life the fullest as a tyrant. 
There are many options for street food, pictures and chai on the Vista... Not much to this - you can't get across to this attraction and are left with looking across the water ( and through the mist/smog ) at this Palace. Very underwhelming Like the proverbial nightingale in a golden cage, you can admire the view from the shore, but cant get near it. Try to visit at night to see the beautiful lighting.

Took pictures with family at Jaipur having Jal Mahal as background . Must stop here when you are on the way to Amber fort or back from Amber Fort. Excellent location We stopped here on our way back from the forts. Its a very surreal looking structure! We wish there was a little more info on the palace. There are tons of vendors nearby so you’ll get hassled a little. JAL Mahal looks good at night only ...beware of the cheap guides..they will take you to the places of their commission for eg rajasthali and Habib shoe place ...those place are heavily overpriced..keep these things in mind and enjoy This is merely a photo opportunity because you cannot go out to the palace or explore it.

However, it is a livery structure and my wife and I were pleased we stopped to see it and have a photo opportunity.

Be aware there are hawkers... This you can plan on your way to other place. Just can stop and take few snaps.

Not possible to visit the palace, but enough to marvel at from the distance. Beautiful location in the lake.

Worth a stop to see and take a photo of in your visit to Jaipur Not much to see from a distance but advise if you tell you’re tour guide to stop and take a few photos See this place in morning when passing by to visit Amber Fort and later in around before sunset to witness the lights getting turned on. While you wait for the sun to set fully do some shopping nearby or just stare at the Jal Mahal... If you’re near this or passing this on the way it certainly worth to make short stop for a photo op. 

You cant visit the palace nor go near. 

Not much more than that except souvenirs that you will find everywhere else at other sights Wao... what a sight.... We wanted to see the palace from inside, but that is not an option...

But people see Jal Mahal from atleast atleast a distance of 1 Km... because this palace is in the water / river.

the best part of this... You can only watch it from bank of Lake.its on same Road while you visit three fort Amber,Jai and Nahar,so plan one full day for all four places. Lovely looking building , apparently there are plans to turn it into a hotel, shops , restaurants etc. At present it cannot be visited and just viewed from the shore. Some locals believe that feeding the fish brings good luck, but lake is now dirty... Only really a brief photo opportunity stop off, but none the less stunning to look at.

You can have some clicks for memory. It's on the way to Amer fort. beautiful historical place

Lots of stalls selling shoes, fabrics, crafts but we were nt hassled by sellers On the way back from Amer to our hotel, we stopped by at Jal Mahal. Had some papdi chat and ice creams there. Lot of local hawkers were selling their stuff and you could spend some time there. My daughter wore rajasthani dresses and we... It is impossible to get closer but it is located on the way to the Amber Fort anyway so it is okay to have a short visit. 

By the way, the items selling around are much cheaper than the shopping archade near Hawa Mahal. No need to halt here.. just ok view.. if u have seen lake pichola or fatehsagar lake u will not find it good. Just lots of public and food der. Worth seeing, a wonderful sight, nothing much to do here but to look and take photos. There was quite a few birds about, watch out for the hustlers and pick pockets, plenty of them here.

On  the way back to Amer Fort you will find Jal Mahal, take your time to relax near it and you can also find local hand made items for shopping. Visited here as a tour and worthwhile to view how an amazing structure with rooftop garden was built in the middle on a lake Looks pretty by night, nothing else much to do in the area.Worth a tut tut drive past if in area. 
Wouldnt go out of your way to see it though. Jal mahal itself has nothing to do but you could see a lot of beautiful things for shopping. I would really like to recommend you to click pictures with traditional rajasthani clothes. Rs.50 for smaller picture and Rs.100 for a bigger one. This is a nice place located in the center of a lake.

All we could do was stop on the side of the road to take a picture, but it’s pretty surreal to see this floating palace that... Visited oct'17. Its a photo stop spot during jaipur siteseen. View is nice. Even in footpath on will get lots of rajasthani stuff- very reasonable price !!! A visit to the lake palace or Jal Mahal is a very attractive sight especially during the evenings - however, it is not really a visit. You get to see the place only from a distance but still, it is worth it given you may... We stopped for photos from the road as that’s all we could do. Apparently, it’s now privately leased. Even so, it’s a wonderful setting and makes for some lovely photos so it’s worth a stop for a few minutes The full Jal Mahal experience obviously includes a boat ride as it is an island.  For full enjoyment this is best done just before sunset.  The city of Jaipur looks nice on the way to Jal Mahal bit even better on the way back in... Good place to spent time in evening. Boat service to jal mahal is not active, so you can only observe it from far distance. But still its good place to spend time and enjoy some street food during sunset We saw this from our tour bus and the next morning I took a walk to get some pictures. It was very special and an unforgettable experience It’s a beautiful place and very iconic. Keen photographers can get some great shots from across the river given the right light - go early morning for best effect. When we have to rely on NHBC for leaks to our modern houses they managed to build and keep two floors which are under water totally leak proof! Worth seeing it in the morning and night You cannot go in as there is an issue with the government over the lease of this place, but photos from outside are amazing. Stop and take some, but ignore the shop owners and ladies with babies trying to make you take pictures with them... This palace is a beautiful spot that gives Jaipur another jewel. Our hotel was just in fornt of the palace and it is wonderful to wake in the morning and have this sight. Sad you can not visit it inside. Good experience when there's water surrounding the area. When dried up, It may seem strange un-true to it's name (Mahal without Jal, (Water)). 
We have seen at both times. It looks Best in season with water.
Otherwise, just a Site - Seeing point with Camel... We went with family for holidays for Jaipur...this is a nice fort to visit ..though entry inside is not allowed as of now ...but outside you can click pictures and night view is awesome 👍 A Palace surrounded by a small lake just
outside Jaipur, a nice scenic place for a photo! There is a place where the locals give food to the rats so If you are afraid of rats stay away from there! But it means good luck... U cannot visit this property as it is not open for public u can only c it from a far away distance not well maintained and also a place to avoid. 

will not recommend this as their are many other places to visit in jaipur.... It’s probably a very beautiful palace but you will not find out because all you can do is look at it from the road. There are no boats or organised trips to see it. The locals call it the Water Palace. 

Don’t go out of... Jal Mahal is the place which could be one of best tourist destination but because of government negligence, its not developed as tourist destination. 
Jal Mahal has nothing to see, you can not do boating, water is not clean, place is not well maintained and... Good looking building in the middle of a lake that you cannot get to. Stop, phot, admire the man made lake and off you go. 10 min max Judging by the crowds assembling on Amber Fort road, this is an extremely popular attraction — even for Indian tourists. Our guide told us that this facility is being developed so that in future, they'll be able to host important events within its grounds. Tourists are not allowed to enter Jal Mahal. But worth stopping for quick photos shot on the way to or from Amber fort. But besides that, nothing much for this palace. Jal Mahal is enroute to amber fort from Jaipur. Tourists are not allowed to go near the palace as boating is not allowed in the lake. One can stop for a short break and click some pics You can't currently go to the fort as it's closed for repairs. Also what the photos don't show is an extremely busy road directly behind where they are taken, together with a lot of hassling tuk tuk drivers and sellers. So definitely not idyllic, but... It's a Heritage and is a beautiful place to visit an take family pics... In evening it's even more beautiful with lighting's On.... Nice place, situated in water. Can be reached through boat however now days not allowed to visit from inside. It’s a good place to visit if weather is nice. Must visit. Located in middle of Man Lake the Jal Mahal can be seen from far distance or from a boat. Entry to Jal Mahal is restricted. You can have the view from main road. Take photos and see the Mahal I think 30 mins is sufficient... If you are like me and have limited mobility Jal Mahal, is perfect, because you can only see it from the shore!

It’s a cool building, and definitely worth stopping to see, but there’s not really much to do there. Plan it into your itinerary, but you won’t be long!

Lights at night and the nearly empty footpath which is usually filled with hawkers during the day make it ideal for a light evening stroll... A place that can be viewed from road, no one can enter inside jal mahal. No entry fees is there. So you may visit it from road side. We could only see this from afar.

Try and go and visit the place at night when it’s light up, but be warned the lights go off at nine. On the way to Amer Fort so must stop for a photo of the water palace. Bit of a market vibe along the lakefront with craft and offers of magic shows. Very good palace mid of the water it's just amazing and riding nearby by bote, realize Royal Family of Jaipur! Though you cannot travel to the Mahal but worth visiting in evening as the lights make it look even more beautifull. The authorities should get the water body cleaned time to time u cannot enter, just need to see it from far.

The boardwalk on the water has lots of merchants and lots of people, tourists, etc.  You can plan to spend an hour... Water around Jal Mahal is very Stinky. You are not allowed to go near Fort, watch from road itself therefor no fee is charged. Nice view and place looked pretty but you can only view it from a distance and the waterside - where you can see it best is full of tuk tuk drivers, street sellers and other
tourists - so quite busy and not the best attraction... A must visit if you're in Jaipur. It appears to be a floating palace in the middle of the lake. It'slike a picture perfect place and you might consider going there during sunset and /or in bright light. It is soothing. Unfortunately, because of commercialisation,... nice place build in center of the lake good view beautifully built you can see good sunset view from this place It really is a lovely palace in a lake. IT was closed to the public when we were there but it still looked nice. In reading the other reviews, it seems that it is possible to go into this Palace.  We were not given that option.  We were told that this was a photo stop only.  The history of the Palace is interesting and it seems like a beautiful... It looks good at the centre of the lake., However cleanliness has been not observed beside the lake...Too dirty t won't take much time just 10 min to see the place ....Inside place is not allowed..... This palace is situated in between man sagar lake Jaipur .. This palace is looks just awesome and very beautiful ... It was renovated by amer rular jai singh second ... This palace have great rajputana style of architecture which made it marvellous ... Every... Went here in the morning and it was very quiet but by the afternoon there were market stalls open which was nice.   Just a stunning beautiful place. It is must see place, the most admirable thing was sunset on this place, we hired a photographer which you can get roaming around and get a pic or two clicked in Rajasthani traditional dress. 1. This a great place, the only downside is its not open for public view from inside.
2. Centrally located, not too far from the city.
3. Can spend about half hr.
4. Some cool stuff for shoping on the street  side. Its very good fort in the river. There are lot of people who give the food to fish and there are also elephant riding but its paid It has now become a place where people put their garbage and rowdy and useless men roam about. You can look at it from the road and dont bother to stop Unfortunately one cannot go insde and can aonly view from far away. Even the boat rides have stopped. Better to go in day time. Night view was disappointing. It would be a beautiful place if it had been built on land but the fact its in the middle of a lake makes it even more special. The uniqueness of this building lies in the fact that it is housed within a lake. Jal Mahal means Water palace and this palace is actually within the Mansarovar Lake.  Built as a summer stay for the royal family members, the architecture of this building... Jal Mahal or Water Palace is standing in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake and there is no road connecting to it. I have visited the palace from the road (on the way to Jaipur City).  It is a perfect blend of Rajput and... It looks awesome in the Pictures available on the Internet but it is not as good as it seems. You can find it on the way to Amera Fort. Our driver stopped by here as we were reentering Jaipur. It is a very beautiful Palace situated on the water. According to our guide the same man who built the Amber Fort built Jal Mahal as a retreat during hot weather. While you cannot visit... A must stop on your way back from the Amber Fort. Such a unique place. Beautiful palace built in the middle of a lake. Great photo opportunity. Only a pity you can't visit the palace but apparently this may be possible in the future.  Loved... Jalmahal in itself is good but faces cleanliness, parking, mosquito and hawkers issue. This place could be developed into a great water sport destination by government if they take initiative put some effort !! Our driver told us that it is prohibited to enter the palace. But it is in the middle of a Lake and that is a good view. Jal Mahal is in the city and you can easily view it while going to forts. Visit this place in the evening to have some good view of Jal Mahal while lightning. It is a crowded place and you can find lots of hawkers available... When i came here first about 20 years ago, we could god inside the palace. but now it was closed for public. so just have a glimpse of it from far its on the way to amer palace so no extra time u need to see it.... take a few picture and enjoy the evening with local snacks and shops around..... An artistic beauty and great display of architectural brilliance, this palace is situted in middle of pond and looks so elegant early morning after sunrise and then later in the evening. The occasional cool breeze sets up your mood as well. Perfect place for clicking... A Beautiful looking place surrounded by water. A nice example of Rajasthani cultural art/ older palace formations. Fascinating architecture and history... It was good to see locals and foreigners visiting the place and whilst the place was a bit crowded, the staff managed to ensure that venue remained relatively clean and that the crowd movements were organised. If you are crossing by on the way to the fort, is OK to stop 5 minutes to take couple of pictures and go away. An excellent place to show case the picturesque beauty and for fun filled water sports in Jaipur. But...!!! 
Completely unkept, stinking and full of beggars at the water front soils the mood completely.
I even wonder that this city has not been able to encash... For visitors this is  a great attraction. Place is good for visit  in winters and after monsoon.Nicely mainted attraction Our stop was just for a photo shoot because there was no way to get to the summer palace of maharajah Jai Singh II. The place is in the middle of the lake as one can see in the photos. Apparently, the lake rises during... We stopped to view and naturally didn't visit as we didn't have our trunks with us. Impressive, soothing and reflective This is one of those destinations you really just get a peek at. It's quite beautiful. I'd suggest coming late afternoon so you get the best light to see it in. Great photo stop. Lots of camels around if you're in the mood for a... I was told this was built for the kings to rest after they return from hunting. Cool place to be in, surrounded by water, cool breeze blowing. But can only imagine this as this one cannot be accessed from inside. One can only see the... Its located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city. Not so much special on this . this ok type monument.. You can view this on the way to or from Forts.. You can't go inside its restricted .. you have to... The jahal mahal is located outside the jaipur.. the castle is surrounded by the water... it is the muzt visit place in the jaipur... and i loved it so much.. The food decor and atmostsphere outstanding.  The staff was amazing food fantastic the building completely out of this world.  Great experience This is an ok place. If you're interested in seeing ""the real face"" of Jaipur, going here will do. It's still quite touristic, so there will be plenty of people trying to sell you stuff. As many people mentioned before, you can just see the... Nice Place to visit.. this place seems to be the best part of Jaipur. One should visit this place for sure. Jal Mahal is beautiful palace.This is Historical site.this Historical building is construct in surrounding of water. This is a beautiful place but very very dirty (lots of trash and dirt ) and poorly maintained area. Lal Mahal could be many times better and enjoyable if it was clean and well maintained. Such a beautiful palace and setting, spoilt by rubbish, touters, hawkers and broken water fountains.  It's a shame as has so much potential, but still worth a visit Its a pretty place to look at but you can only look at it from afar. Click a few photos and be done. It would be great if there was a service which could take you inside it and check it out! Since this building is in a lake and entering is not allowed for visitors thus you can just see it from onshore. We checked in for 3 days and I have to say that it's the best hotel we have stayed in, in India so far.

The massages are so good and attention to service anywhere on the property is immense.

The Cinnamon restaurant was so real... The palace itself was good to look at but the area was very dirty and full of hawkers stalls and beggars We heard it is going to be renovated and open as a restaurant, but who knows how long that will take?
But for now, from the shore, it is lovely to look at.  For better photos, try to visit when the sun is not directly... Visited this during the day and could not believe how underwhelming this place is. The photos usually taken at night are truly spectacular. During the day, it is a filthy, dirty, rubbish infested lake that needs some respect and cleaning up. See my photos for... One cannot visit this palace but the view itself is charming.  Sitting right in the middle of the lake one can view it from the main road and walk along the promenade tourists are not allowed to visit this place. it is closed permenantly.
you have to see it from distance. better to remove this place from list of tourist destinations in jaipur Beautiful piece of historical architecture, but just rotting away due to negligence and unhygienic conditions. We went there around 8 in the night, and the place was crowded by both tourists and locals, strolling, eating, having a good time. The place is well lit and... Very good water palace i enjoy indiya first water palace. And jaipur city was great city (pinkcity) .. I just ad to stop for a picture.  Butifull located in the midle of this lace in the outskurt of Jaipur. It is not possible to sail over, so a picture is al u get. But worth the stop. It was nice to take pictures of this summer palace.  The people selling things around the site were not overwhelming.  It was fun to see and a great place for beautiful pictures. I visited Jal Mahal while we got back from Amber fort. There was a nice lake and the building was in the middle of it. We just watched it from distance. Near the lake there were some locals who sell indian stuff such as handicrafts,... While returning from Amber Fort we went there and stayed there for 15 minutes...nice place to have a picture and nice place to buy some local attractive things in a cheaper price compared to Jaipur big shops!! The Jal Mahal when translated into English means the Water Palace but the complex was never intended to be used as a palace by Maharaja Madho Singh I. Madho Singh, who constructed the Jal Mahal in 1750, simply wished it to be a lodge for... The veiws of the building are stunning. A lot of people around selling things and trying you to dress up in local clothing for pictures. Don`t get pushed around. Visit took about 5-10 mins as not much else to do there. Superb engineering but sadly entry is stopped since a few years. Comes en route to Amer Fort. Situated in the centre of a sprawling lake is this magnificent marvel. Well it seems too good to be true, a rare sight which can only be seen in Udaipur apart from this place. Its like a floating palace. 
Definitely a must visit if you are in Jaipur, I did fell in love with this place, the... The lake is beautiful with Jal Mahal in the background.   Not sure if you can actually visit the building.  We were on the lakeshore and saw it from afar.  However, this is a GREAT area for street level shopping with all kinds of folkloric artwork... After visiting the Amber Fort we stopped to look at this fascinating palace. It has a feeling of haunted peacefulness. The lake that surrounds it was man made many years after the palace was built. Worth a photo stop. This building appears to float on top of the lake and we found out is often used as a back drop for family occasion photos. What a super background for a wedding photo. The day of sunday... Many rush of people there. There are many activity. When i reached i found many types of fish are coming in side of lake and take bread. This place located in middle of man sager lake in Jaipur city. This place attract visitor towards to it. It is look miracle because of it situated in water. The water and grounds around the palace are disgusting.  Trash is all over the place.  It's a shame that the Indian government or some other group doesn't tidy up this palace as it has a lot of potential to bring in tourist revenue.  We just... This beautiful architectural wonder can be seen in the lake but the view is marred be the trash along the waterfront around the lake...it is unfortunate because the site could offer so much more... We were lucky to stay in the Trident hotel right opposite, so did not have far to walk for great views. The palace looks great from a variety of angles and in different light conditions. There is abundant bird life along the lakeside. the walkway... From last few years this place has again become a point of attraction for foreign as well as Indian tourist. It has happened because the water has been cleaned and many local and foreign migratory birds have come this season. 
Do's-
1. Prefer to go... Located between Jaipur and the Amber Fort, the Jal Mahal - seemingly afloat on a serene lake - is a portrait of solitary beauty, to be admired from afar. A monument unique in the world! This is turning into a hotel in a couple years, but until then you can see this beautiful palace from afar only - no one can enter. Jal Mahal is very beautiful building.this palace is located in water.this fort is on the way to Amber fort. It was difficult getting to see the jal Mahal close by so we had to view it from the street across the lake. No comments The place is a beautiful sight but maintenance is poor.hope to see some work in future and there are humour in the market that in the palace some work is going on and it is going to convert in hotel in the future You can view Jal Mahal only from far as you cannot go near it because of it being a protected site. But, nevertheless it is a beautiful palace. There is a crafts market near the place from where you can buy local handicrafts or get... Looks beautiful from outside but there is no way to go near by this place. This is protected Historical site No doubt it is lovely, surrounded by water. People were taking pictures. A person can buy local stuff from street vendors but government has to work on it. It is not at all maintained, was stinking badly. Its a pretty place for photo-shots. The palace looks great. You are not allowed to get inside the palace. Only for viewing the palace from far. The boundary maintained from the main road decorated with statutes and at various points there are bins but still... Jal Mahel is one of the main attraction of Jaipur. Beautiful Mahel in the center of the Lake. There's a roadside market also near Jaipur where you can buy crafted jewellery, bags and Showpiece. What a view, enjoy a pleasant walk along the promenade with a view like this.  Any time of the day it looks spectacular. Only wish there was access to the interior. Fascinating that the palace was built as an air conditioned structure. Would love to know and see the associated concepts included in its construction. Lots of activity from viewing section that is also fascinating. On the way to Amer fort we came across JAL Mahal. You can hire traditional Rajasthani attire for RS 100/150 and click photos and move ahead. You can't go inside. Yes, it's a lovely looking building in a beautiful setting. Sadly it can only really be admired from the lakeside several hundred metres away, so what could well be spectacular detail in the building is not so visible Located in the main market .. I have been in Jaipur since 2013 and visited many times there ! Amazing art and design.. 🎑 Great to stop off on-route to view from afar and to ake photographs but you cannot actually visit it. We were lucky enough to view this stunning piece of architecture from atop a camels back. It was a amazing ride, the gorgeous flowers along the ride, the company of the camel handler and the site of the Jal Mahal.....what could be better? Jal Mahal is a palace located in a lake and looks like it is floating in the water. The experience would be nice if the water and area was not full of trash.  I don't think one can visit the palace.  I'm not sure its... A beautiful view from the shore, and certainly worth at least a brief stop for some photos.  I was there twice, once around midday, then again at dusk.  Pretty colours as the light starts to die. Impressive structure in the middle of the lake but shame it's not fully open lots of potential but interesting to see. OK for a quick photo stop but nothing breathtaking. Very dirty area where you can but all sorts of cheap rubbish. This palace in the lake is a world famous picture, but only a photo stop really.  I believe you can visit it, but we never had time  The area around it is poor and not in keeping with the grandeur of the palace I love the view of the Jal Mahal but the surroundings are beyond dirty. Shopkeepers in the area sell loaves of bread and snacks, which people buy and just throw in the water for the ducks to eat. And believe me, the ducks have enough... Can see only from roadside, building not approachable some litigation problem not worth going specially. Must visit place in Jaipur, but you should accompany with a guide or a local person to give you information. Best time to visit is early evening when sun is setting down.. or late night. You will nice undisturbed view,plus amazing color scheme if you... we saw it from the main road and clicked pictures,
i do not know if we can go inside.the parking is easily available and free Jal Mahal is very nice place and very good local market at Jal mahal but you can just view palace out side lake there si no boating over there so just take a selfi with Jal Mahal :) It's just an average spot to take pictures as you cannot go inside jal mahal due to government restrictions. Would be interesting to see from inside once its reopened. While we were going back to hotel from jauhri market after shopping we saw mal mahal...And it's beautiful....I am unsure if one could go in boat or something to see this place. Worth a photo but that's about it. 
The stories surrounding it are interesting but other than that you can't see much The best part about this heritage building is that it has a breathtaking view. The worst part is you cannot go inside the lake and need to appreciate only from a distance. This is a must visit when you are in Jaipur for its picturesque... This is only something you can see from a distance as you pass by.  You can't really go in and see this.  

This is important to note as you shouldn't really keep any time aside just to see this.  This can be covered in the... nice place for taking pictures specially at sunset , too bad no one is allowed in the castle island premises, you can only appreciate it from the distance This temple can be seen from the road. It looks like it is floating on the water. You can see a lot of water birds feeding on fish near the shore. We saw a mongoose. There is a nice cafe as part of the petrol... Absolutely stunning sight, not worth going just to see this, but perfect for on the way to or from Amber Fort. Jaipur trip is incomplete if you miss jal mahal attraction.
Situated in the island and is a beautiful property to have a look on.
A scenic view with the environment makes it more elegant.
Next time surely visit with my family too. The palace in the middle of the lake is novel and therefore of some interest, but is not accessible. So on its own it rates a few photos or selfies.

However there is a promenade on one side of the lake with vendors selling Indian... This is a must see....incredible.  Can't believe the work and detail that went into this site. They've done a great job keeping it in good shape. The jal Mahal has been closed for tourists. People can only take a walk along the lake and click pictures or ride a camel/horse. Boat services to the jal Mahal has been stopped. Can be seen on the drive towards Amer fort. Sitting by the lake one can only imagine the royalty of erstwhile kings who used to go the palace in middle of the lake to enjoy the cool breeze on hot summer evenings.
A romantic place to be for people of all ages. Saw this from outside. Seems like a very nice place. Lots of food and little shops along the road. Beautiful palace but unable to go inside. Nice picture opportunity. you can only take photos you cant visit
you stand in an area where there are families relaxing and market traders
pleasant to see The location of this ""pleasure"" palace out in the middle of a man made lake is idyllic and my photos (not on this device, unfortunately) will paint the same picture: pretty. But even my guide was saddened by the pollution. In fact, he picked up... This is only worthy of a quick picture really. We visited late afternoon on our way back from a day out and would have been disappointed if we had for there on a special trip. It was lovely to see in the late afternoon sunshine... After your pics, walk doen the street to see camels. Get the man who writes your name on a grain of sand to do some work for you. Only Rs 50. This is one of the must see place in Jaipur. It is around 10 km from the main city and you can see this place on the way to Amer fort. Didnt really like the views. Thing is Indian people are so dirty that the lake is disgusting so that doesnt help at all fof the picture. Such a normal one, seriously This is an amazing view and the advertising tells no lies I've added a photo I took from our hotel room ..it was the old hunting palace of the murgal king  who used it as a bolthole to escape his many wives to go hunting... Jal Mahal is a drive by experience. You can spend 15 - 20 mins there, click some pictures and grab an ice cream while  you are there. Jal Mahal (meaning ""Water Palace"") is a palace located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city. Jal Mahal is a palace located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city. Can see only from roadside, building not approachable.... I just fell in love with this place! This place is just scenic beauty. 

However, I would have been a lil more delighted if the place was free from hawkers and all. 

Since there is no way you can go near the building, I am... ""The Jal Mahal palace has got an eye-popping makeover. At present there is no way to enter in the mahal and have its look from inside. One can only view it from outside. As the name suggests, it is Jal Mahal (Building in Water). It is a palatial building in a beautiful lake where large number of birds can also be seen in a backdrop of Arawali hills. This building has been restored recently so looks like as... a place which is surrounded by water, these days not accessable because of risk. you can spend palanty of time in evening.camel ride also you can have. When i was see jal mahal i was shock...
I think how it is possible that between pond there is building... Jal mahal was very old ...
Second thing in jal mahal is stone scenery is made on road that was also amazing..
And night... Not exactly an experience. One can just look at the palace from a mile away, as it is built on a so called island. And the siderails for sight seeing are not very well maintained or clean. Get stunning views of this palace from the ferry boats (ask the local folk), & avoid the over-priced crafts. we have seen by the road because approach to the mahal is not available so not able to see inside buts seems wonderful as per other forts and mahal in the city We stopped for a quick stop after visiting Red Fort and might have been the guide just not sharing much with us, but other than a quick picture and short history lesson, not much to see here. Well. Jaal means water in Hindi. The palace once upon a time was belonged to the king until the goverment took it away as a taxation from the king 50 years ago. Its seems the palace was a place for partying for the king with... This palace must have been amazing in it's heyday. Now abandoned in the middle of a polluted artificial lake its  still worth a look though with a bit of money and imagination it could be so much more..... Drive by, snap your photo and move on. The Jal Mahal is currently closed and is looking to reopen as a hotel in the future. Be aware, the area around is quite filthy and as a female...the man were really bad about staring here (most... A visit to the Amber Fort will take you back in history plus give you a clear insight to the social structure that existed. The obligatory Elephant ride up to the fort give you a feel for the mode of travel in those days &... What a shame we were unable to take a trip to the palace, i am sure if you could visit up close it would be well worth the cost. A lost opportunity.
It is a beautiful sight.
It was very busy on the street with... There is nothing much to explore here. You can not go inside the palace just click photos from lake shore that's all. If short on time you can give it a miss. went for the company meeting in mid of jan , place called jal mahal is beauty of the pink city must visit . The area around this palace is also very traditionally Indian and the view from the square was really a sight to see.   We saw some local children catching fish and the palace guards over daily activities on the shore in a majestic way Jal Mahal offers a very picturesque sight from a distance, even far off distances. The exteriors are illuminated only on special days, so not  really an attraction on dark for most of the time. As some renovation is in progress at the moment, it can't... The expectation versus reality is far different. You are not allowed to visit Jal mahal. you have to watch it from a far off distance. The only best part in day time out here was shopping and eat outs. May be this place looks better... This is roughly An Hours Experience to See the Mahal and have A bit of Photos taken.
Too Many Touts Around and Very Dirty Around the Area Considering its a Tourist Attraction-standards Need To be Lifted. Stop to take some shots
We were on a Sunday the side walk was crowded with street merchants who sold cheap soveners it is good place to visit in jaipur, but don't expect too much with the place, because it is 15 to 20 min place only. It's located in the middle of Man Sagar Lake in the city of Jaipur  . Very beautiful n magnificent architectural wonder of the city .
Can be seen from outside only . We can go , stay n can have beautiful pics as it is... Not open through out the year. But by all means you can stop by and click some pictures. Thats all there is about Jal Mahal. I took one of my favorite photos in the early morning light there.  But there isn't much else to do but admire the symmetrical, mostly submerged palace.  It's a bit out of town--so we reached it via a bike tour (Cyclin' Jaipur, who were good).... It's a must visit place in Jaipur. You will not be allowed to go to the Jal Mahal but will be able to take the close views of the Amazing Palace in Lake by walking along the Amer Fort Road.
We were staying in a... you have to see it to believe it, experience the exterior, the interiors and the reflection in the waters , it is just beautiful.... Great place for taking photos,saw many birds flying around and saw the beauty of the palace,its incredible that how It is situated in the middle of the water and the how its constructed,I enjoyed it and read about it on the internet.Will be coming back... Great view..Definitely a place to visit when u r in Jaipur and can spend about an hour enjoying the view. The lake was created by constructing a dam across the Darbhawati River, between Khilagarh hills and the hilly areas of Nahargarh, in the 16th century. Unfortunately the palace is closed to the public for renovation but this still is a sight not to be missed in Jaipur. The side walk across is also very colorful and fun with all sorts of people selling different food, toys, souvenirs etc. All in... I love the view of Jal Mahal however we cannot get into the building and can only take photos outside.
漂亮的水上建築，可惜無法進去，只能在外面拍照，但是景色優美，風光無限，很值得經過時停下來欣賞。附近有很多水鳥，夕陽照在水面上真的很美。 Beautiful and must visit place for all. Once you must go there with family or friends. But we can't go in Mahal Cannot go inside,  watch from a distance.  Opposite is an art gallery , don't  visit unless interested in paintings. If you are with young kids visit the place but otherwise not a great place to visit . Instead rest in hotel or visit shopping mall We stopped by  and could only view the magnificence in the water.  It is out of bounds  and people are no more allowed there.  It has a splendour all of its own. Place is very good to travel. the beauty of the nature can be enjoyed when there is a cleanliness. As a tourist people, once cant expect. But it is dirty/Polluted. Can be taken care. Beautiful location , positioned in the middle of the lake 
Regrettably you cannot go inside but understand they are considering to let tourists visit in the future 
Surrounding area i.e. Walkway that allows you to view full of shop keepers plus a little dirty but... It is located opposite to trident oberoi . Jalmahal  is surrounded by water . No visitors visit inside this mahal  , no fun  it's not a place to visit  . Can't come It is a nice architecture
Too bad the lake is now polluted with plastic waste floating, it downgrades the site.
You can skip it  but worth stopping 5 minutes on your way and take pictures. you have to see it to feel the beauty of the palace, the reflection in the water amazing, you have to go by boat We are not allowed entry to Jal Mahal but only can take pictures from the shore. The entire shore is so dirty, we dont feel it is a tourist spot. Jaipur administration should get this place cleaned up to encourage tourists to visit this place. A stunning must visit palace set in a lake. Best to visit early evening when cooler and you can find a variety of colourful souvenirs being sold by locals on the streets which you can barter down to great prices. Take a camel ride and... The view of jalmahal is really good .I had morninh walk around it and felt nice but as you have closer look,you will find lot of garbage around and at places water stinks

You can find many pigeons coming to have grains whixh you can... Our guide told us the story behind the palace of winds and we stopped to take a photo. It is not possible to go there but the photo came out well. Since visitors are no more allowed into this lovely palace ,we had a photo stop on way back from Amer!
There are lots of.birds in the morning.
The serene lake with the majestic palace look magical in the morning light. We were on a personal trip to Jaipur and heard that this is one of the must visit destination. It's a good view but the surrounding is really unclean and quite unhygienic. There is no maintenance of the place.
Everyone has the access to this... Situated on the road to Amer fort the Jal Mahal is a nice photo opportunity. It is not possible to visit the palace at this time,  although our guide suggested there are plans to turn it into an hotel. 
Our guide also stated that the... This place seems amazing, but unfortunately you can just see it from far. Apparently, the water around it is so nasty that no one can go and see the place. The tour guide said that sewer stuff is mix with water there. Beautiful palace on a man made lake.  We literally stopped to take photos and left,

You will be asked by a lot if locals to purchase a photo session or gifts. If you don't want these please say no and most of them will walk... We can't go in there which makes the place just for photograph purpose. Not a must place nothing more to experience rather from a photo The setting of this palace is very nice. The Indian government is cleaning the lake and transforming the palace into a hotel. At that time boat rides to the palace will be available.
In Jan 2017 we could only take a few pictures from the... saw it from outside n did nt enter ..wud like to visit here in my next trip...it is also regarded as a must for tourist to visit This Palace is majestically situated in the middle of a lake amid rolling hills Whilst on shore there are exquisite bronze casts of the Royal Family and entourage arriving by elegant etc. at the equally imposing jetty gate, the Palace itself remains beautiful from afar...

Some floors of the palace is submerged in water. The number of floor submerged at... The view of Jal Mahal in Man Sagar Lake is beautiful but the place needs maintenance. Firstly the lake needs cleaning coz the view of the dirty water hampers the lovely sight ahead. It would also be nice if hawkers were restrained from the area... It is place on the way to Amer Fort. While coming back from Amer Fort , one can relax here for a while and see the scenic beauty of Jalmahal . Entry in Jalmahal not allowed. You have to see it from a distance. The Water Palace is a gorgeous architectural wonder on the water, which is unfortunately abandoned due to an ongoing legal battle between the Rajasthani royal family, who want to retain it as their summer home, and the Indian state, who wish to sell it to... It's beautiful to look at from the waters edge, and will be even more exciting some day when they allow access to it. The area on the waterfront was interesting as well as it seemed to be a little carnival-iike in the evenings around sunset.... Great view of the faded opulence of a palace (actually a shooting lodge) in the middle of Lake Mansagar. You can't get to it so this is only really a photo and quick sightseeing opportunity.

Try and get photos of the rats in the garbage... Dissapointing - dirty, littered and hassled alot by guys wanting to take your photo. One saving grace was amazing street food . The property I guess is not accessible for common people, you can only click pictures from the sides of the Lake On the way back from the forts, this lake palace is worth a stop by, the walk by the road is usually crowded by street vendors. Nice temple on the lake on route to the fort. Can't see inside but makes for a nice photo from the roadside A nice looking palace on the lake. Not much you can say about but that.

Plenty of street vendors creates other photo opps.  Only a brief visit is needed as it is not possible to get to the... Please be advised that this site is only a stop by and take a photo only. Hopefully you will have a clear day to be able to capture a good picture.

Nonetheless, still a very interesting site that will soon be undergoing restoration this was part of our itinerary and we thoroughly enjoyed the day - I loved seeing the elephants bringing the visits to the fort all decorated - the fort has some lovely rooms and we were surprised at every turn - a must to visit this is located on the way to amber fort. nice spot for a small break . would recommend this place for a evening walk as well. just enjoying road side snacks and a nice walk enjoying the view. This palace was used by Kings as a private meetings . Nice view around Jall Mahal.  great panorama view and Spending 10-15 min is enough . Jal mahal is not open for general public. We just halted there for few minutes for a photo stop. Its right in the middle of a big lake. The footpath there is an interesting place in the evening as you can enjoy nice stroll along... Our hotel was right across the street so we could see this lovely palace in several different lights.  It is pleasant on the beach and lots of activity.  The sales people are not pushy so one can look and enjoy.

It's a palace situated in the middle of lake. You can have a walk around the lake. There are lot of street shop for ladies shopping and stalls for eating chat and coconut water. Probably this is the only monument which you can see with... Nothing great and spoilt by litter on the lake edge. Hawkers add colour and movement and good for a quick stop for tea en route to Amber fort. Brilliant photo opportunities, this watery palace once used by Maharaja as a private retreat now disused. There are plans by government to make it a tourist attraction but just to see it from the road to Amber fort is enough for me As palace can not be seen from inside you may take photos outside and do shopping, horse riding camel riding etc. We stopped at the Roadside to take a pix. I think that is all that is needed, although I did enjoy all the hustlers and souvenir stands along the path. We stopped here on a little board walk and viewed the Jal Ahal. We were told no-one lives there anymore, the government has taken it over. There are venders all over the boardwalk. There was a vender where you could dress up and have picture... Used to be a great place to go in the evening, turned into a stinking water hole. Very disappointed to see mismanagement of a wonderful location they should develop the lakeside properly. the water is very dirty and stinks. its a place only fro few pictures... they should maybe have boat rides at this place and could go near to the mahal. This palace is built in the centre of Man Sagar Lake. You cants go in the middle of lake and visit the palace. But you can see it from bank of the lake. Good for photography on the bank. You can stop by for few... The palace is built in mid water. and you can get the view from banks as you are not allowed to go till there. Bank is clean good for enjoying a walk and having a very good view. Its a majestic view to watch Jal Mahal from a distance, but a bit disappointed to note that visitors not allowed to enter the mahal due to lack of boats in the lake, also from the view point we could see all city garbages etc... Seen this place from road also but the view from nahargarh fort is quite good. Also when you see it from roadside too many vendors there. You can't actually go in to the water palace but it looks pretty from the shoreline. The lake is beautiful with walkways around it and people selling their wares. It's a nice area to spend half an hour away from the busy streets in the... You can view this place from afar , it is not accessible. The whole area is strewn with garbage. You'll get hassled by groups of kids and hawkers. Jal Mahal is beautiful by anyway. But no one can enter that. We can only taste the beauty from a long view (ie. from the banks of the lake).Spend some time on the banks with your loved ones. Nice view, you can see lot of... Honestly, I expected a lot from this place but it literally turned down my high expectations as the water (jal) for which it is known was literally stinking and not clean at all. I really feel this place has a beautiful view and Jaipur tourism... Although I never went inside but this place is awesome and outstanding. It is in the middle of the lake. The architecture stunned me. I loved this mahal. A very beautiful view while on the go to Aamir Mahal. A good place to try the chats, golla etc on the lake side. Has a semantic view to click great pics. Am not sure if we can go to the palace but a must... This is a palace built on a lake for maharajas to go on swan hunting. The lake is filthy but the view of the palace is nice if you are a photographer. 
You can spend about 15 minutes here. From a distance the palace looks nice but the approach area is horribly polluted with plastic and garbage. This is not at all acceptable. This is a structure in a little lake. You cannot access it, only view it from afar. The surroundings are quite filthy with lots of hawkers. Been here with 1 ov my bestie on her bdae n realie njyed d dae. It wz her 1st time 2 d place bt she realie liked d sceneric view, the lawn type made garden n food joints. In d evenin d view gets mesmerizing... It's a floating palace on the way back to Jaipur from amer. it's basically just a photo stop. But the area near the lake where you stand to click pictures is really smelly and unkept. It's littered, and it's off-putting. It's an attraction best seen... It is a beautiful palace, at least all information said so; but you can´t go in or even get near. You can only take a picture of it from the side of the lake. It is said to be the resting palace of some Kings... Great site to visit. But unfortunately its just a fleeting glance.I expected to sail my way to it but nobody is allowed to do so. You can just watch it , capture it from the banks of the river. The other thing u can do... The water palace is a beautiful photo opportunity. 

We stopped on the road outside the palace on the way back from Amber Fort, while on tour. Jal Mahal, name itself defines the structure and view. After a tiring trip to Amer Fort, Nahargarh Fort and Jaigarh Fort, this is the place, where you would like to sit and relax. It is placed so beautifully in between Mansagar lake and surrounded by... We had visited the place in february and inside entry was not allowed . What you can do is just take pictures from outside and do shopping in market having  vendors sitting roadside. Outside view is good . Our giude told us, they will light the palace in the night. 
We just arrived around 21:30 at a Dark lake.
From far looks nice.. But nothing special, nothing bad We went there before sunset and the landscape was picturesque. The place is flooded with crowd - both tourists and vendors. The tour driver informed us that Taj has taken this palace on lease and would soon develop it into a 5 star property. That's... Jal Mahal is a beatiful place. 
Don't go too early. Have too much fog, and you can't see all the beauty. Excellent Palace, Must Visit. Different view in the morning and different in Night when lights are ON That's all you can get.  You have to stand at the bank and cherish the environment and click photographs. one cannot go to Jal Mahal, it can only be seen from the edge of the lake, which becomes alive at night. one can even have photo in Rajasthani dress with as low as Rs 50. The shopping options available are quite cheap. One time visit. The palace looks beautiful at night. If you are in Jaipur, you may try once. Right in the middle of a water body so that is quite interesting. Best time is in the evening - it is on the way back from Amer Fort. They have made it into a sort of picnic spot where one can relax watching the Mahal. Plenty of strrt food stalls plus coconut water and masala soda. Souvenir... The view from the shore is enough to blow away by the magnificent view of Jal Mahal. A must visit place. It is on the main road. The location is beautiful and Place is well maintained. Spend less time if it is a part of your city tour because because amber palace and Jaigarh fort will take too much time. For Leisure time it is best. very nice building surrounded by water. We just had a view from the side of the road and it's quite impressive. It's a shopping hub and is good for ladies. People who dont have time to visit the congested market like Johri Bazar, this is a nice place to shop with reasonable price. Lot of options and a very long market tail. The day was very foggy the day of visit. One can see this place from the shore. It is been renovated to become a hotel. The shoreline is more interesting with local Indian tourist enjoying the various photo ops and the locals with their stalls. Though we cannot enter the palace, this is a must visit in jaipur for a fantastic view. Perfect place for a selfie & other photo-op :)
Enroute to Amber fort/ Nahargarh palace. Alot cleaner than alot of monuments I have seen in India. I guess over time you begin to notice it less and less. There are lots of people selling things at stalls around the area and alot of time can be spent just browsing these.... Great to see when staying in Jaipur and you do not have to go out of your way as it is on the way to Amer Palace. Thoroughly enjoyed watching the locals and taking in the atmosphere. We just stopped to be able to see this beautiful palace located in the middle of the lake. It is not open to the public due to some legal disputes. Close to the public with no access. It makea for beautiful photos though especially when it reflects on the water Must see on the way to Amber fort, it's just on the main road and you will not miss this. Nice place to visit anytime for clicking couple of pics. Not very well maintained. We had a look at the palace from the main road only, as it was not open for tourist sight-seeing. We stopped here, on our way back from Amber Fort. You can enjoy a camel ride for a nominal charge at the entrance. Its a nice place to hangout in the evening with view of the Mahal. Entry to Jal mahal is not available. Lots of snack stores and fun activities are their. Nice place to see.  Surroundings eye soothing.  Great place for photography with family specially in jaipuri  style. A must visit site with children. This is the place where a tomb is situated between the pond and looks like a royal havelli and gives the felling of living in the time of raja's or ancient time. the surrounnding around this place is best for outing and and for enjoyment... We stopped by to see the Jal mahal on our way to Amber fort… the palace looks great from outside but unfortunately is not open for visits… so just a few photo clicks and we were on our way. This is situated just off the lake. amazing photo point 

juhu chowpati of jaipur. At the top, there is a garden which has semi-octagonal towers in every corner. Although any time is a good time to visit Jal Mahal but it is during the monsoon... Jal mahal looks good from a distance. One disappointment is we are not allowed to take a boat ride to experience the beauty of it. The mahal is under renovation and is getting converted into hotel. There is a lot of lore behind this Mahal, and many facets of its history that need to be placed in a detailed write up at the site. Cleanliness and taste is another area that needs to be brought up to international standards, given the... If you are in Jaipur you must be here for sure
Amazing view you will be mesmerise seeing the beauty of jal mahal A good place to stop and take a picture of for about 5 minutes, you won't want to stay by the road any longer than that Tip: You will see Man Sagar lake and the Jal Mahal when you leave Jaipur to go to Amer to see the Amber Fort. This attraction is best stopped at on the way back from the fort, as you can avoid playing frogger trying to... It is an okayish place to check off while travelling to Jaipur but there isnt much to admire. Its simply a palace built in the middle of a river body. The place has vendors but is very dirty. We stopped off in our tuk-tuk on the way back into Jaipur from the Amber Fort and boy the was no comparison.

If your passing stop and take some photographs as its a very picturesque building sitting in the lake and of course it was... We had visited in the evening for the sunset. Crowd is not really great. You are guaranteed to be visited by kids who have learnt few magic tricks and say ""hum aapka dil garden garden kardenge"" :) Visiting this reminded me of R K Beach... Good for photography and some roadside hawkers souvenirs. otherwise nothing much to see. Photographers will like this place You can plan this place on return from amber fort to new jaipur.There is no transport to ride in the water. Infact We felt that they are mainiting water just to add to list in the attaraction. Just a spot to take some snaps.Not so... We visited mid day. Pretty view, especially the reflection at that time of the day! Worth spending a few minutes at.. Only exterirors visible !! No mode of transport to travel to JAL MAHAL !! Market on the strip of the lake provides shopping opportunities but be sure you bargain (upto 90%) as they will quote quite high prices on stuff This is a lovely building in the middle of a lake ( I believe you can stay there)
We viewed it on a misty morning and it looks so romantic,
Well worth a photo. Will summarise my discussion with few local just after visiting the place. When I told these strangers that city has disappointed, the quickly, and rightly, tried to defend it. I straight away pointed towards the lake, near to which we were having conversation. I asked... Not allowed to go in. And the promenade leading up to the waterfront is filthy and cluttered with hawkers. Stop, take a photo of the palace, and carry on. Nothing worth seeing here. Superb jal mahal at the center of a huge lake near jaipur on the way to amer fort.... photostop but no other activity only scenic beautiful palace in the middle of lake with lakeside vendors selling street thingies n local fast food Even though the Place cannot be accessed by the general public, you cannot missed it on your journey from Jaipur to the Amber Fort. There has been a lot of work done in dredging the lake, and the Palace is still being restored, but it... I was awestruck when I saw this beautiful palace built on water.  It is so beautiful that you will fall in love with it.  Unfortunately we could not see inside of it and we were shown this place from the banks of the lake nevertheless... This is a beautiful palace on the water to view. It looks even more beautiful in evening with lights. But this required a bit of maintenance and should offer facility like boat to enjoy the view more closely. One can view this place from road only. No way to go near or inside this place. Viewing place is all dirty. Can't do much here accept taking pictures from distance and serving food to fishes in water. This place has a magical charm about it, so enchanting to visit at night. Worth a look! Overlooking the lake it makes for a great picture. I've heard you can enter but i didn't at the time i visited. Jal Mahal is the very important place of the tourist I'm going many times of Jal Mahal with friends family the water fish Great, relaxing and full of ambience. Can unwind after a day of sightseeing. Perfect setting from bar to gift shop to restaurant to gardens and evening activities. You cant possibly write detail of this stunningly place words cant describe what you are visiting you just need to   Come and see for self This palace is in the middle of the lake. It's a  good for a bird watcher. The best time to visit is during evenings when you can relax and enjoy the view of the lake. a 2 min stop for pictures is all you can do here. the mahal is inaccessible, no boat rides there , is surrounded by filthy pond with millions of dirty fishes.

Totally not worth it

can be seen easily on your way to Amer fort It is a nice place having good view.  Building in lake looks like flootin in water. Big attractions point for tourists and nice place It is a awesomeness of palace in jaipur. The mahal was situated in water .wonderful fort in a pond of water. Very nice place . And nice walking .this is vey nice and you should try it . This is my recomend to you. Its the holiday spot of royal king in ancient times.

From outside can view the Jal Mahal & lake. 

If got kids then can take photos in ethnic wear. 
Well crowded all time.
Small platform shops selling... This is not open to tour, but it was a lovely picture spot on the way to the Amber Fort.

There are beautiful monuments, there are historical places and there are magnificient huge forts. But when you combine all of that together.....you get the true masterpiece.....Jal Mahal.....beauty, elegance, historic and magnificient.

Constructed in the middle of the lake to have a cool summer retreat by... The lake is full of trash, people throw breads n all for fish, this is killing the beauty of the place This is supposed to be the leisure spot of the Earlier Kings. This is located in the middle of the lake and no one resides here. It is however a good place for photographers.

You can click difference photos along with birds and animals. You... It looks pretty from the far but if you step out and walk near the promenade , you realise that the lake banks are full of filth and breeding ground of mosquitoes and flies. A water lake representing the culture. Some monuments are constructed between the water. Right now there is no boating. Best for Summer. Roadside view. Camel ride also can be enjoyed. Just loved every single second at this place....it mesmerise u...d cold breeze....d scenic beauty ...reflection of moon in water giving a beautiful glow to jal mahal...d place u wanna stay forever You only have short window to visit jal mahal at time of sunset, after that it will be so dark , better to stop for 20 minutes and get some pic clicked, you can also get some cheap traditional items from local vendors outside. Saw it from afar. It is in a man-made lake and looks great from a distance. In the backdrop of the mountains, it looks pretty. Well jal mahal is not accessible to regular tourists and you can only see from a distance. But the distance view is also good and breath taking . You can happily go for a short walk early morning around this place. In the evening there... Rajasthan tourism who is spending so much money on advertisement should visit And see this place. A historic monument put to shame by the garbage around it. This is located in centre of the water body. One cannot visit the jail mahal and you have... It's a peice of art of one of the historical building you will find in jaipur the best timing to visit would be in evening as there will be beautiful lighting in the palace. If you want closer view there is a way close to... This is a beautiful palace on the water to view, but that's all you can do is view it.  You cannot go into it or go out to it.

So, at best you can just see it from the shore, with the palace in the middle of a small lake.  The water is not clean nor are the grounds,... This palace isn't open to the public but is a must see when visiting Jaipur. The palace sits in a lake and is one of the regular stopping off points for visitors to photograph. Apparently there are plans to turn it into a hotel. You cant able to go to the jal mahal since there is no boat service to the place. The Jal Mahal is too old and not safe to visit inside as it may colapse at any point of time. Do not look at the dirty water but marvel at the history of Jaipur and its kings and queens that built so many wonderful forts and monuments full of romance and valour. Stroll along the side walks and behold the scene of mountains and water... Jal mahal is famous attraction in Jaipur. It looks beautiful in the evening. We enjoyed a lot with our guest. The park around jal mahal was very neat and clean and there you can also take camel ride. This place have very good view and romantic sight seen even. best place to go in evening and stay till night, eat walk around sit there very beautiful place to visit and spend time.

It has a mahal like beautiful look surrounded by lake. During night it really looks fabulous. Jalmahal as its name tells u palace situated inside the lake .You can see jalmahal on the way towards amer fort. Jalmahal is surrounded by lake and has around half km walking zone.Great for pictures but unfortunately lake shore is full of dirt and filthy... We can enjoy the view from a distance only .its quite beautiful anyways..wish that we can go by boat to the palace. Swapnil was an excellent tour guide and really made the trip special.  He and his tour company are highly recommended. Stunning palace on the lake flanked by mountains (you can't actually  go in it). great for pictures as long as you later crop out all the disgusting filth and rubbish collected on the lake shore (which is sadly so often the way in India). It would be great if there was a boat ride up to this place. The surrounding area was not so clean. so it needs more clean up We visited the foreshore to view the Jal Mahal twice, once during the day and once at night time.  The boardwalk along the lake edge is worth a good half hour to hour long stroll to take in the views and all the venders.  We... Like I suspect most people we stopped here on the way back from the Amber fort. It is a really impressive sight and looks really good in the photos. A beautiful sight. It looks like a beautiful palace because I watched it from riverside. I wish I could go inside. This palace can be used as a hotel or a restaurant like the Maiden's Tower in Istanbul. The riverside is very lively, there are many souvenir vendors... JAL Mahal was so nice an beautiful amazing this the first time visiting there an have fun with my wife it was so great an beautiful I wish text time will visit once again Iconic site and a must see when you visit Jaipur. Its on the way to the Amber Fort and worth a stop to take photo's and be careful dodge the hawkers!! We only spent a few minutes here more for the photographic opportunity than anything else. It's a lovely view if you can get there at the right time of day for the sunlight but other than for the photograph not sure why else you would... Although you can only watch it from the lake's bank it is fascinating. The palace and its reflection in the lake with the background of the mountains form a great spectacle. It is a beautiful monument on the way to Amber Fort
It is situated between a lake and looks mesmerizing,however,You can have a look at it from Riverside only and cant go close to it.
It is not maintained at all and is dirty at... Site is good where u can see it quickly from far from road however mistake we did to step out and had walk. The pathway is poorely managed with a stink all around. Not much currently but there is supposed to be a restaurant going in sometime soon and the boat ride over will be part of the experience so while not much now. Stay tuned. This jal mahal place is very good to see and it is very beautiful to see at night time  
and one bad thing to say is presence of gutter near to mahal and it's smells very bad. This is one of my favorite places in Jaipur. The view of the palace looking like it is floating on the shimmering blue waters is truly magnificent. Walking along the shoreline boulevard and taking in the romantic vistas is a must for any visitor to... The palace sits in the middle of a lake.  It looked beautiful. It will be better if visitors are allowed to enter the palace. Jal mahal itself must have been beautiful at one time. But the surroundings are not maintained well at all. We just stopped on the road and took some photos from afar because you actually cannot go to jal mahal. The roadside spot is very dirty,... You can drive by this while in Jaipur, besides for some pictures there isn't much more to this sight. Rumor has it that it is going to be turned into a hotel. You get great views across the lake to Jal Mahal. Unfortunately we could only stop during the day. I believe that it is fantastic lit up at night. Apparently it is being converted into a 6 star hotel so maybe you will be able to... Jal Mahal is a five storeyed palace built within the Mansarovar lake. During rainy season, four of the storey of this palace remains submerged in water.  This was built as a place to stay during the hot summer season.  The concept of building a palace... Loved seeing the views whilst passing but stopped on way back  ..... moving experience well worth the visit One cannot go inside the jal mahal, but seeing from outside is so impressive that one feels to go there and spend time.
Its good place to take photos as well. Very beautiful monument it comes on the way to amber fort. Please do visit in evening. Nice for clicking pics Really pretty looking place sitting in the middle of the lake. Just a shame that currently it's going through the courts to decide whether or not it should be turned into a restaurant or be opened up to the public. 
All the same very picturesque. al Mahal which means ‘Water Palace’ is one of the magnificent architectural wonder of Jaipur. This Palace reflects the perfect blend of Mughal and Rajputana craftsmanship. The palace has been constructed amidst Man Sagar Lake, which provides an enchanting view of the lake and the... unfortunately you can't visit due to obscure reason.
It's worth making nice photos there. Beautiful building.  Better have good binoculars We love this place, it is on the way to Amber fort, I think this is really very romantic place.. and perfect for selfie.. One of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. It's definitely a must see. Ask your driver to pull over for you to see. Great place Situated in the lake, this inaccessible palace makes a good photo stop on a tour. There were lots of fish in the shallows and some interesting birds, unfortunately the rubbish around the edge of the lake spoilt it. Absolutely gorgeous, just before sunset.  Take a leisurely stroll along the esplanade and you will find interesting hawker stalls and a view lovely view points, for photos. Like so much in Jaipur this building comes straight out of a fairy tale. Fight your way through the hordes of hawkers to the lakeside and take a couple of minutes to take it all in. This was one which you can admire from a distance.Situated within and surrounded by a lake full of fish,ducks and some crows.A nice sight at sun down but the pavement area sadly was full of strewn garbage.No charge to view it from a  distance. Great view and stunning architecture. Just shoot some photos from roadside. You can make good photo shoots during sunset. There are many goods sold nearby. Walk to them without your driver or guide and don't forget to bargain to get best price. A must see if you are in Jaipur, just a shame it is not possible to view the interior, one can only wonder.
Beautiful to view at night. Get a guide and let them explain the many facets of this fort /palace. Many places have much to learn but must have guide. Audio guides were available but we did not use so I do not know how effective they are. As beautiful as the water palace is, it is just a 5-minute stop in your way back to Jaipur. Crop-out the banks of the lake, and you've got a fairy tale setting. The downside is that you cannot really access it, and the lakeside is... Beutiful place and also amid the serene enviornment but can't visit the Jal mahal. You can't visit to JAL MAHAL rather view from the roadside A nice monumental building right in the middle of a lake. Nice location with handicraft, textile and jewellery shops nearby. Lot of craft sales by the pavement also. The Palace was very beautiful once upon a time, but now due to lack luster approach of local government, water outskirting the palace is very stinky. Though government has made a beautiful pathway outside the palace. You can atleast take beautiful pictures from here. This palace was built by a king for his brother. Only accessible by boat but government stopped boat trips because the water was getting too polluted. Absolutely full of fish you can see them from the banks and fishing is allowed once a month. A lovely place to watch out for Sunrise & Sunset and in night it gets more beautiful because of the lighting. Good for taking photos. Always full of crowd, Like a Choupati of Mumbai for locals.
It's nice just the management has to work hard... The palace is not open for visitors for we are allowed to stand by the side of the lake and admire the architectural wonder.

 Its a nice spot for a night picture when the place is lit up.

The place around the lake is not... The palace is located in the middle of the lake and cannot be accessed. It used to be a place of entertainment for royalty but now is closed and abandoned.

The place is well maintained,kids can roam freely.If you purchase any local product that also you may purchase,but bargain it.
Overall you take fresh breath over here. This is a beautiful building in the middle of a man-made lake. Our guide told us that the building was built first, and then the dam was closed and flooded the area. It is unfortunate that you cannot visit the building now, but apparently a... Good view , located on broad road near Nahargarh Fort , boating facility available .  Needs cleaning though . On the way to Amer fort and near the RTDC building. You can see a old building in the center of the lake. No access to this building via boat or other means. Good for a glance. Lakeside is slowly becoming dirty and a garbage... It is stunning to see this beautiful structure. We were not allowed inside the premises and were told it is shut for tourists. First of all it provides the most picturesque view on the Amer Rd . It's like a mini version of Mumbai Marine drive, it's really beautiful set amid Mansagar lake. 
But the entry to Mahal and even Boating is not allowed in Lake anymore. 
Hills... We were told that it is not opened for entrance. But the view is great and the story behind it makes a lot of sense. Located On the road out to Amber Fort it is is well worth a stop off to view Jal Mahal. 10 minutes from central Jaipur. The park around the Jal Mahal is currently closed so you only get to view from the road side at the moment. Well worth a stop for a photo opportunity if passing. Lovely building set in a lake with a great backdrop for photos. If... The palace is not open for the visitors, you have to stand by the side and enjoy the natural beauty. It is surrounded by a lake from all the sides and one has to stand near the lake and then admire its natural beauty. The... No transports to this place at present.  But the view of the lake is good. the water getting contaminated by sewage water. But camel riding activities are available on the shore.  the pudina jaljeera soda for Rs.20 is a worth drink to taste there I'm not sure if this place can be visited but I got the view of this beautiful palace from a distance when I was travelling on my way to visit the nearby location in Jaipur. Just the view of it made me feel like going... Its a calm and peaceful place to go and sit. Best time to visit is either early morning or late night when its not so crowded. Seriously speaking, I was very disappointed with the maintenance of this place by the authorities...water is super polluted, surroundings aren't cleaned, peoples throwing garbage... Also the route to the Mahal is closed... So basically all you can do is to click some selfies with Jal... Jal Mahal is a palace constructed within the Mansarovar lake which is the largest artificial lake in the city of Jaipur.

The place is not open for general public the lake surrounded by water is very beautiful to watch a man made wonder. Middle of a man made lake ..

Went to see the partially submerged Jal Mahal, but was not really excited by seeing it as one can't go & visit the palace.
All one can do is walk the side banks & have a good view of it's exterior. We visited jaipur in the second week of sep 2016.We could only have a a look at jalmahal only  from a distance. Neither was there any boat service nor road way. We could never understand the idea of keeping jal mahal as a tourist place. It is a charming photo opportunity better maintained than 15 years back. Not that much but definitely getting crowded. Tried to see if we can do anything else but told not possible to boat or anything Any idea why? Like Sheesh mahal at Amer, even this palace is closed for visitors now. So you can enjoy the beauty from out side only.Good place to take snaps at.... Worth to visit this place one. It's on midway to Nahargarh n Amber fort. View of lake is amazing n one can enjoy camel ride here. It's kinda of beach in desert.

Though the palace built on the water looks serene and beautiful, but the area surrounding is full of garbage, camel dung, which really spoils the beauty. This fort is good.

So it's not like you are visiting the place you kind of just pass by it. It looks good at night. Other than that there not much to it . Nice viewpoint but not a lot to do. Read about the history of the place, take some pictures and move on.
I don't recommend coming here if you don't plan to visit other attractions nearby. Try to get a car or auto with a local driver who can show you all the attractions in Jaipur. Reaching particular places were difficult for our car since many roads were closed / diverted due to Metro construction work.

Jal Mahal is a small... The palace can only be viewed from the lakeshore.  There is a wide paved promenade on the lakefront.  I found there was an unpleasant smell, possibly from stagnant water.  The palace appears lovely from the outside.  Trident hotel across the street has rooms with beautiful... This looks so attractive but unfortunately you are unable to visit so have to make do with a view from the road across the man made lake.

Nothing much to do here...you can just take some pics...walk around...it's all about history and the life of royalty...interesting...:) Palacw on the water mainly used by Maharaja for bird and duck hunting. Unable to visit inside, it is more like a quick picture stop. Beautiful nonetheless. Vendors selling local goods. Haggle, haggle!! According to our guide, this used to be owned by royalty, but then the government took it over and they are turning it into a hotel. The Jal Mahal is a nice bit of scenery to look at and capture some great photos. You can only look though, you can't actual get to the palace.

The waterfront turns in to a street market in the late afternoon and there's the opportunity... Jal Mahal is located in the middle of the Mansagar lake of Jaipur completely surrounded by water. Now a days it is not allowed to go to the Mahal so you can only see it from the road. The stench of the lake puts you off from afar. The Jal Mahal could have been a pretty sight, but the upkeep is bad, and the lake is stinky and full of garbage. We left the place in a hurry. Jal Mahal is the replica of Bandra Mumbai Carter Road...It is a place where the kids and children can enjoy and have fun. They can go on with battery operated car riding. Also...for road side shopper's there are all the vendors sitting around selling chappals,... Very nice view of jal mahal its amazing

There is no separate way to this fort. It is located near the main road, so don't get fooled by cab... This is a stop-off rather than a visit.

With the Aravali hill range view in the middle of the lake this palace built. Probably public are not allowed to enter inside now. Jalmahal is a very beautiful palace created inside a lake.

It was stinking like hell and all the food was thrown in to the lake... and some time the sellers out side wont allow u to enjoy the place. Apart from all these it is a good... Spend the afternoon there. A very good place for birding and street shopping. A very good place to do bargaining.  Again went in the morning for more birding. This palace is submerged partly underwater, so not accessible to the public, I don't think. View from side of the lake, roadside, for free. Nice to look at and I would recommend, but quite a lot of pollution in the lake. You can see Jal Mahal from the street on your way to the historically famous Amer fort. It's located in the middle of a lake and looks stunning with its reflection in the water during the day as well as night. Unfortunately, you can't go... Wow, this place was amazing. Ignore all the people selling things and you will see the amazing palace riding out of the lake. Turns to pink hews at sunset, well worth a trip India in a nutshell - lovely architecture, lots of families enjoying the stroll along the waterfront, snacks and knick knacks to tempt you to buy, pigs, cows, dogs, birds and rats foraging in harmony in the garbage along the shore.  Just block out the sewage... We went to this place in the evening time and honestly speaking,  the place stinks like hell! The water surrounding the palace is heavily contaminated with all sorts of waste and gives a really bad smell which can't be tolerated for long. Besides there is... On way to Amber Fort, you can stop by while coming back for some photographs. Currently not allowed to go inside, but there are plans to open it for public in the future and work are going on to open up a restaurant inside. But,... The images you'll see when doing an internet search are of the Jal Mahal at the most opportune of times--with the sun casting golden-hour light on the exterior of the building, and the wind completely still so the water is undisturbed and reflective.  If you... Nothing much to do here , just an old palace in the middle of water. Not great looking, just time pass visit Government not allowing to visit this palace from inside. It's surrounded by Lake. Lake is not in good condition and water smells. Just stop on walkway near by Lake and have photographs. Viewed it from the main road. Took a couple of family photos and left. The areas near this road is not clean. 

Not sure if there is a boat ride available to the Jal Mahal. The Jal mahal is nowadays declared unsafe to visit. You can just see the building from the lakeside.

You just need 5 minutes for this spot. A lot of local vendors around this place sells local snacks which make it seems similar like juhu-chowpatty of mumbai. 

The... For me this was on the way from my hotel to airport, View for so breath taking that i had to get off and take few pics. There is no entry for visitors to go inside right now. Not worth watching it. You can easily skip this place in Jaipur as it is very untidy place. Not recommended. I was in love with the place since it gave me amazing back drops to snap.

It is located on the way to Amber Fort from Jaipur. Fantastic history and, therefore, worth a stop on the way to or from Amber Fort with a local guide. But, it's far away and not accessible beyond snapping a picture from the shore of the lake. The palace is on an island in between a lake, seeming inaccessible as of now. A very famous photo point for visitors. Visit during evening hours in Monsoon season to get the best viewing pleasures. I go there pretty often for photography and morning drives. It's pretty cool place to chill with friends. Hope for a clear day. Best time to get a good photo is in the evening before sunset. There are many families on the esplanade at this time...they love to have their photos taken. I doubt that if this ""attraction"" was located anywhere other than on the main route up to the Amber palace from Jaipur anyone would really bother with it.

There is also no boating. Would also give this a miss. Being a photographer this is one of my best place to capture everytime, This monument is best and finely get captured in any angle.

A beautiful place to relax your eye. Beautiful Mahal inside a lake. During summer lake will be dry. On the way from Hawa Mahal to Amer photo, a few minutes stopover will give you a better photo opp. The best you can do at Jal Mahal is grab a photograph / selfie or two. It looks like an impressive structure in the middle of a lake from afar, and that's the only way one can judge it. Entry is forbidden for anyone other... Good looking palace.

Nice for a distant photo shot. Shame Entry is not allowed.

Cannot explain much about this as visitors are not allowed to go to the Mahal. They should open it to visit When you visit jaipur, please do view the Jal Mahal. You ca'nt reach to the Mahal. It would be viewed only from the Main Road, since it is surrounded by water. Seven floor of the mahal is submerged in the water I had visited Jal Mandir with friends and the place is really awesome. The whole experience of travelling in a boat curved with different animal heads & roaming around from a narrow corridor to an open garden was mesmerising. Must visit place. This place is a delight for people who want to get out of the hustle of the city and spend some time with their friends and family by the calmness of still waters and gardens.

I would strongly recommend people to visit this place early... The beauty of this place can only be viewed in eveing. The lights give it look of a vintage car from some angles and the street market is a good place to get bargain items. Can only be admired at a distance. Equivalent to maybe the Chowpatty of Mumbai.

It's a beautiful construction in the centre of the lake. It is not accessible by public, but the promenade surrounding the lake is beautiful to walk around.

My guide told that its 3 stories are dipped into the pond and only one story is... its a nice palace built in a lake... but it can be viewed from road only and cannot be visited... a good place for a perfect family picture.. Ah! When we think about Rajasthan we think of camels, desserts and turban tied people wearing colorful costumes. You are wrong! Many of the castles here are surrounded with plenty of waters giving you an extreme feel of Royalty an while visiting Jal Mahal you... Its a very coll and sadabahar place in evening at the time of sunset. There is a Choupati in evening where you can eat something chatpata... Good place foe couple and family. Camel ride is also available here. Its not really a floating architecture. It's after they open a gate and let the water coming in for??? PLease survery it before you go. As ours just drop by and take a photo on it. As per tourist spot Jal Mahal is not adored by many people but the only thing which strikes my mind is the amazing architecture of this historic heritage. It has been submerged partially in lake from beginning still the monument doesn't seem like being affected... We were not able to see this building closer, all we can see is from far and the floating Jal Mahal looks so beautiful especially during the sunset. This palace is in between waters and we cannot go to the palace as such. We need to have a look at the view from the shore. One can click nice scenic pictures here. Can spend half an hour here and not more, as nothing... In udaipur, a jalmahal is located in the middle of a lake like the one in jaipur. but it cant be visited in jaipur unlike udaipur. u can take a look of it sitting on car seat only as nothing else is made to admire...

It is gorgeous and there is little woder it is one of the signature... You can't go onto the island so it's just another good photo spot, but is on the way to the amber fort so is a must see. The mahal is pretty amazing just sitting there in the water. Make sure you stop for a pic... beautiful view and surroundings..also the night lights are very pretty...should definitely stop by to click some pictures here :) as you cannot even get in properly. The ""lake"" was dry. Hardly any water. Dirty water. There are so many better places to visit in Jaipur please go to those. Tripadvisor gives an accurate description of the places worth going and not worth going. Ok, so JalMahal of jaipur is quite a good place to visit, but right time should be selected to do so. This is a palace surrounded by lake. The whole beauty of it comes out when the lake is full of water. I live at... There is nothing much to see other than the seeing the  Jal Mahal in the middle of the lake. Take a couple of photos ... 15 mins max.. if you want you can buy some knick-knacks from the pavement vendors .  On the whole -Drab.... OK, so Octopussy is lame, however I was young and the idea of coming out of your crocodile shaped transporter thingy in your white dinner jacket impressed. 

Well this is the place that they shot that scene. The actual Mahal is not accessible and is... dawn or dusk is the time to visit this palace, or at least to photograph it. It does look absolutely amazing sitting low in the water. Jal Mahal is nothing but a palace surrounded by water all around. You are not allowed to go in. People watched from road far way from it. The lake was once pristine and still looks OK. The structure in the middle is however not accessible as its under litigation and thats takes away the best part of the trip. 
Once real great time to visit would however be the Kite Festival that... This is like the symbol of Jaipur, of course you have to go see it.  Frustrating to deal with the vendors outside and guys selling drums, but hey, it's still India. We were staying at the Trident hotel in Jaipur and this was the view from our balcony of the hotel.  We didn't travel across the water to visit inside - I don't know if you could but overall it was a lovely sight - and... The palace was closed when we were there, but the view of the palace in the middle of the lake was amazing. Definitely worth a stop. A must see and visit, the view can be normal if you are around just by mid day, but I recommend visiting during sunset, a much better chance for photography, just watch out for all the sellers who might follow you trying to sell you...

It was place where we got our best photograph of the trip.awesome and clean road. beautfiul lake  and nice JalMahal in the back drop. Also you can take breads from vendors there and feed the fishes in the lake Summers are extremely warm in jaipur and at times even acs fail to help. This place, maybe because of the water is cool even then. It looks like it is floating on a lake. The camel ride was an amazing experience, Definitely go for that I was really looking forward to this on my trip through India but found that it wasnt as impressive as it was made out to be. I enjoyed taking a few pictures as we returned from the Amber fort. First off, you cannot get into the palace. So all you see is the view from around the lake. That , by itself, for people like us who haven't yet seen Udaipur, was scenic and beautiful.

Walking around the place are lot of locals and... This mahal at the center of an artificial lake is good to see. At present no body is allowed to go there. This monument was once used by the kings to entertain his wives. This is enroute to Amber fort. In front of the monument,... First look to the palace is amazing, seems like floating on the lake. If you have chance to see Jalmahal from nearby hill, you will be amazed, it lies in the picturesque place. 
Entry inside to the palace is not to the general public as... Jal Mahal has aesthetic as well as environmental importance. Its interior paintings have been renewed and its a blessing for sore eyes. Paintings with themes and various artist have been assembled and the staff takes care of hospitality. A beautiful place and the boat ride... Jal Mahal is built in the middle of lake.  It can be viewed from afar.  When we were there, we saw a little boy doing magic treats and speaking English to impress tourists.  It was heart warming. Essential to have a guide.  Try to visit when it is a cooler part of the day it can get very hot here as there is little shade. Palace appears to be floating on the lake. Visit it after dark (but before 10pm) to see lit up, and then more impressive. Moderate number of hawkers. The boats are not there so one can take photo from the road side. However in evening time its good one can relax there. An evening stroll along the walkway is good to take in the beauty of this water palace from a distance. Tourists are greatly disheartened at the inaccessibility of the palace; though one can have good photographic opportunity. Its a  nice monument .How many thing people can do for their comfort! An Emperor built the Mahal for his Begum to keep her cool in summer.Its a symbol of love but i think the Emperor could spent the huge money for betterment of people.Anyway... The location is pleasant, the view is good!
You can probably have a photography session, or just look at the water and the birds. Good place to be during EVENING! This place sounded so promising, but it was a bit underwhelming.  The building itself is lovely and it's a romantic idea to see it in the middle of the lake.  But, as far as I can tell, you can't go inside.  So, it's basically a... Like other travellers have mentioned before, this is great to look at from a distance but not so great close-up (a real tourist stop and beprepared to be hassled by street traders). Rumour has it that the property will be sold to a hotel group... I was really looking forward to seeing the Jal Mahal on my trip to Jaipur. It is certainly a beautiful building, and I knew beforehand that I wouldn't be able to go into it. I was somehow underwhelmed by the whole thing. Maybe it was...

You can walk on the promenade at the lake front; however, the place is dirty and its a great... It is on the amer highway and you can have a distant look only, as the palace does not have an approach road.It is covered all around by water and nobody goes there.You can take photos from a distance,that's all. The rather small palace gleams like a jewel on the lake, as seen from the highway that runs towards Amber Fort. But the interiors are a delightful surprise, with long corridors, rooms, a garden full of plants and flowers, and there are enough paintings on... Jal Mahal.

If you really want to see the locals in a comfortable... We were able to see this palace right outside of our hotel balcany. It is very beautiful. Since we did not have time to go to Udapur we felt this gave us a little touch of that city. It is a good photo stop.

Place around the palace has been done nicely and spending a short evening must be a great idea even for the locales and... Take a stop at the lake and see this palace, its like floating on the water of the lake. Its a beauty surrounded by water..worth to take a break there. Please come early in the morning at Jal Mahal and walk around the Lake
Very pretty..it is about 15 min walk from our Holiday Inn Hotel downtown Jaipur/
The place is magical early in the morning when it is not too hot
and locals go... This is a pleasure palace built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in 1799. You can't visit it because it's in the middle of Man Sagar lake (although I nearly did get there once when the lake almost dried up after a particularly poor monsoon). 

The... Jalmahal is located just opposite the Trident hotel n Jaipur. There is a nice garden area and structure where you can spend some time n click some good pics. You can also have some cool tender coconut water & quench your thirst before moving forward.... While all you can do is stare at this beautiful mid 18th century palace - it is more than enough.
When the lake is filled with monsoon water, the palace seems to float on the water.
It's impossible to understand just how magical this sight... We have seen jal mahal several times but only from outside.It is spectacular and heard lot of things about it.So really i can not give detailed reviews about this Jal Mahal (meaning ""Water Palace"") is a palace located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city. It is enroute from Amber (Amer) fort to Jaipur city. It is an excellent piece of Architecture and an ideal photographers delight Nice water palace to see sitting here in this picturesque "" Man Sagar lake "" with the mountains in the background. You can't visit this palace, but we had a view of it from our hotel (trident) and it's beautiful. We were informed it is hoped it will be made accessible and hopefully into a restuarant...so stay tuned I guess... Only able to see this from the road, it is hard to write a thorough review although clearly another iconic monument within Jaipur and in that regard a must see. Well you can visit this at your way to Jaigarh or Amer etc. Jalmahal looks stunning at night but this place is only for view. You cannot go to the Jal Mahal since no boating is allowed. You may come here in the evening at... I did not understand how the water are around and what is the purpose to  make in between the water.....here i feed the many fishes, which was touching experience that atleast i did it somthing Nice site. anyway you can't go near it. the boat rise is closed. 

The site lies on your right while going from jaipur to amer fort, you might like to stop for a while.

i was travelling on holiday so there were throngs of local... This is a mini palace built right in the centre of a lake and it was said that this place was used by the kings during summer to cool off... very cool! We could not go into this palace and could see it only from... we visited this place on the way to Amber fort. it looks very pretty from the road. it was evening when we approached this place, the sun was setting down and the lights were lit up at the palace, the reflection of the lights was... Jal Mahal (the Water Palace) was just opposite our hotel, the Trident in Jaipur, and we could watch it from our balcony. It's an old palace in the middle of a lake. You can't visit it, just watch it from the street. It makes a... the place is simply outstanding. You will be simply felt breathless by seeing this great work of architecture in water.Also don't forget to feed fishes. It is in the middle of the lake (like the one in Udaipur) and did not appear to be open to the public when I was there. It's pretty and is quite a scene in the early evening with all kinds of street vendors. It's amazing view of the Jal Mahal in the center of the lake especially if visited in the morning during the sunrise. Its amazing to imagine how they would have constructed this palace way back in the middle of the lake. Keeping that thought aside, there is nothing much this place offers for the tourist.

We visited this place, while on our way to Amer/Jaigarh/Nahargarh fort in... The palace itself is gorgeous. As other viewers have said it is closed to all people, not just tourists, as the owners and the new government battle over the ownership. (The owners bought it from the old government for a tourist attraction and opening it... Couldn't actually get to the Jal Mahal - its closed to tourists. However, we were able to admire it from the roadside. The beauty of the palace however, is marred by all the rubbish strewn all about, and floating in the lake its a good place to enjoy the scenary. Drawback is that you cannot go and see the jal mahal from inside and no boating is allowed.. We stopped here on the way to City Palace from Amber Palace and it was a lovely photo stop to make. You can't enter it but it's definitely a photo opportunity that should not be wasted. We stopped here on our way to Amber Fort and during monsoon it looks like the palace is floating on the water. Really nice to see but that's the only thing, you can't enter or anything so after 10 minutes you can leave again. Though you are not allowed to go inside like the Udaipur Jal mahal...this ones good to go in the evenings.Beware of the local boys staring at you and asking you if you want them to click a photo for you! 
Surrounded by hills from three... This is situated across the hotel we stayed in ( Trident Jaipur) and we crossed the road both days. From the other side of the road, one can get great shots of the palace ( floating) . At the same time this area is a... We have been back 2 years in a row and I keep hoping that someone will do something with this beautiful Palace. Unfortunately one has to admire it from the shore as one can not visit the attraction but from a photography angle the reflections... This is part of the City Palace and a very nice place to visit. You will see beautiful stone carvings and architecture. This building also houses the largest silver vessel in the world. Often there is dancing and busking music troupes playing around the open... This is different in terms of architecture but in terms of beauty, there are better places to visit in india. I was recommended to visit this by a friend and to be honest, the upkeep of the place, makes me wanna give 4 stars to... I guess there are plans in the works to make it accessible, but it is great to look at from far away. Wonderful place to visit but be careful about local people.  You will need at least 1.5 hours for this location.  Maybe 2 to 3 hours is good also. Maye i am too critical, but i was not impressed by this palace. But i think everybody will have own impression; located on road from Amber to Jaipur, it is unavoidable. Try to bypass it on dawn or  (shortly after) sunset, maybe then if will... Date of Visit: 26th Mar 2013

Fees: None

+ point:
(1) It's quite beautiful and I suggest going around afternoon time (which is probably the time on the way back from Amber Fort - I was there at 2pm) because when I reached at about... We visited this place on the way to Amer/Jaigarh/Nahargarh fort. It looks very pretty from the road also from Jaigarh fort. The only drawback of this place is we can't visit the palace. There is nothing much this place offers for the tourist.
No boating... Just saw it from the side, did not get a chance to visit it inside. If I did or do in the future, perhaps I would rate it better. It was too hot for a ferry ride so decided to chuck the plan even if... The Jal mahal is located in between the lake and you can only click photographs from far as it is not accessible On our way out to Amber Fort, we saw the most amazing site: a palace floating in a lake.  From the guidebook, I was confused. Was the palace flooded? Was it built on an island? What was it doing there? Built in 1799 as a... Inside it is like a maze - many rooms, corridors and passages. Nice architecture and do not forget to see the facade from the street side. Its very well built but sad thing is we cannot go inside. We have to look at this place from a distance. Jal Mahal palace was good.
But the view of the palace was awesome.
i really like the palace....and definitely you also like the palace if you go to Jaipur Stopped to look on the way back from amber fort. No reflection in the water. Pretty far from the road. Not really worth a visit. Cannot visit, just see it from the bank of the lake. Looks stunning on a sunny day. Do not need to spend long. Lots of touts selling trinkets by the viewpoint. The venue was poorly maintained and the water had a foul smell due to pollution etc. The palace did not look like it was maintained well. apparently there is legal dispute around a commercial lease for running the venue. brilliant for travellers and the place to spend your evening as this place has everything as in camel rides , horse riding , things to eat and yes at times the crowd is not that good but for people who wanna enjoy the place with... Saw the Jal Mahal from the road as I dont think anyone is allowed to the palace in the lake. Looked pretty from a distance but is definitely not as outstanding as some of the monuments I saw in Rajasthan. We had stayed in udaipur before visiting Jaipur. So the jal mahal did not quite impress us as we had seen nicer palaces on the lake in udaipur. It is just a small palace on the lake. You can take pictures from afar. Could not... From the shore this 'water palace' is an amazing building, constructed in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. Even though the lower level is currently flooded and the building is abandoned,it is still an imposing structure.  You cannot visit the water palace as it is... Jal Mahal (meaning ""Water Palace"") is a palace located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city. It is enroute from Amber (Amer) fort to Jaipur city. It is an excellent piece of Architecture and an ideal photographers delight When return from Amber Palace Jal Mahal is between. Lot of street vendors selling stuff there, place really good but can not go inside, Lake is beautiful and nice to walk around. Rajashthani arts can be purchased from there and someone can really enjoy negociating... It is an iconic image but the reality is that the lake is right by a very busy road not what I expected at all. We stopped to take photos but the light was not good that day, glad I have seen it but would... I was able to visit the Jal Mahal through the efforts of our hotel concierge, though the palace is technically not open to the public. A quick five minute boat ride from the shore got me to the pleasure palace. I was given a tour... Excellent view from street. You can't go inside. It's again nice monument.Try to go early in the morning around sunrise or go when sunset. You can only see from a distance but worth seeing it, feed the fishes with atta and enjoy the nature Seeing this palace majestically sitting in the lake was just beautiful, it is a shame that it has not been protected or I am sure it will seriously deteriorate as time goes on. These moghuls really did know how to live!! On the way to Amber Fort, stop and take some pics of this beautiful water palace. Can’t access the palace, so only worth a brief stop for the clicks from the road. Travelers are not allowed inside Jal Mahal. Place surrounding the lake is good for photography and hangout. Remember to go in the evening if you want to hang out only. There is hardly any shade to take shelter. You can see Vultures, and many fish... OK you can't do anything but look at it. But what a sight. It's such a shame they don't get their act together and save this building before they lose it. Fifteen years ago, they were going to turn the mail building into a restaurant... Nice view from outside. Don't know how it will be from inside. Maybe have to wait for a few more years to find out. I went to Jaipur looking forward to see the Jal Mahal. I had read an article about it and I was super excited to go and see it. To my disappointment, it has been closed for years, so all you can do is take a... I could not believe the crowds here. It is a breathtaking edifice-the whiteness after dusty India is amazing. The palace can only be seen from outside. Access to the palace was closed for renovation. Apparently it will remain closed for at least 5 months. 

We went there in the morning. It was a bit foggy, the palace couln't be seen properly. 

There are... I caught a tut tut out to see the Lake and Palace, but it was a lot smaller than I had thought and not really all that impressive. Watched in awe...the palace seemed to float on water! Folk singers performing on pavement, Diwali diyas all over the pathway, camel rides and scrumptious street food makes for a beautiful romantic evening...travellers can also get a flavor of Rajasthan royalty simply by driving down the... Stop for a quick look on your way or back from Amer fort, nothing much to see unless you want to do a small boat ride. Especially In the right light.  But that is all.  I do not believe you can visit this palace that seemingly floats on the water. very good one it is built in mid of lake and guide told kings used the same as summer house for them to stay interesting, mind boggling! and a real ode to love! beautiful place which takes your breath away! the structures and grounds are well taken care of and it is just as beautiful as it is described in all magazines!it truelly is a wonder of the world very beautiful mahal to see from the distance,  it should have been really great if tourist are being allowed to to palace by boat.. I came 2 years ago and it was still a shabby abandoned place in the lake, this year it has a huge makeover and all looks great! Beautiful Water palace that seems to float on the artificial lake. Look for the cormorants on an island and fish by the shore. This was a roadside stop off just to take photos. Worth wading thought the touts to take a few snaps. Unfortunately, one cannot go to the island yet since the Government has taken over the palace for renovation. The adjoining Lake drive road is broad to stop by and take pictures This is very nice place to visit while in Jaipur. The photos that can be taken at this monuments are spectacular. This palace is a beautiful sight but that is all. The palace resides in the middle of an artificial lake. It is nothing else but a beautiful sight do not expect to visit it. It is not possible and you would not want to cross... Didnt find much intersting..it is just a buliding standing in the middle of a lake sunk till half of its structure, It looked like an evening place for Jaipur locals as nothing much for tourists otherthan a photograph. This was the first monument we visited and it looked excellent. The view was marvelous from where we stood. The history of the Jal Mahal told us by the guide was very fascinating. The best part was to feed the fishes that came near the... Nice view from the road side, not accessible for tourists or others. Good spot for clicking photographs. I saw Jal Mahal on way to Jaipur city after visiting Amer Fort. This building is situated in the middle of lake but you are not allowed to go up the building. It was any how worth to see a building in the mid of... you can only view this from a distance in the water and there are no options available to actually visit it as it is not open to public...can be easily skipped as it did not seem maintained also...locals mentioned that there are plans to convert... Its on the way to Amer fort. Now this place is only good for clicking snaps or maybe camel ride for ur kids. View is amazing from here as you have mountains at its backdrop. Good place for morning or evening visit You cannot go inside Jal Mahal but can see it on the way or back from Amber Fort.
Park the vehicle in the corner take some photos and you are done.

Best to visit just before sunset and stay till they light up the Mahal... Got bitten by one of the monkeys while walking down from the beautiful monument. I cannot tell you whatnottodoas i didnt antagonize them at all, maybe just respect their territory. If bitten seek doctor! Galandia travel clinic was excellent and freindly with ravies shots and... We just watched it from a distance while returning back from Amber Palace. It is forbidden to go near to it or inside it. You will have to drop down at a place and watch it from a distance. Though the photographs came cool, it... On the way to the Amer fort from the city of Jaipur ,in the center of  an old lake , lies the beautiful jal mahal(meaning a palace in water).A beautiful palace not presently in use. Its a fort in the middle of a lake. Cant go inside it but its a picnic spot with a lot of activity. Reminds of other famous picnic spots like India Gate but a different experience We didn't climb the monument (which you can do for a small fee). That would be the only attraction to this site. It's quite a way up so fitness would be important. Not able to get up there this time due to a minor foot... One of the most beautiful palaces seen. Its a place where every tourist coming to 
Jaipur should visit. I saw this on a list of things to do and just had to see it. You pass it on the road up to Amber fort on the right hand side. Granted, you can't go inside and look around, however, we heard that in the... Beautiful building inside a lake, being a engineer it first strikes my mind , what kind of design principles,machines,engineers, materials they had before many centuries !!! ; the beautiful erection is still intact and as graceful as it was before. Looks great across the water, but a boat out there would really make the trip! I'm sure the authorities could line up something with some really traditional Indian wooden boats. In fact it would really bring the lake to life. On the way to the fort, This place has to be seen in the day as well as night so dont go here during the regular city tour. Watch all the places and then while going to the fort just stop over take some pics... Who knew astronomy played such an important role in the Indian culture.  It is a beautiful facility and amazing that time and effort was made to build it. I'm born and brought up at Jaipur, but now have been staying in a different city from many many years. Jal Mahal has been my favorite since childhood! It has been in ruins earlier.... But recently I came to know that it has been given... Stunning lake palace but shame not to be able to get a boat out to it when i was there in Dec 12. Beautifully lit at night and lots of birdsong on the lake. Currently just a photo op but rumor has it that it will soon be a classy restaurant.  It is a terrific location. It is amazing to see this palace in the middle of the lake; looks like it is floating. Although you can only see it from distance, it is very worth to stop by. Although there is nothing much that one can do except appreciating the  beauty of this monument.. but the beauty speaks volume.. 
This should be visited during the sunset time.. It would give a different impact..
Jal Mahal falls on the way to Nahrgarh, Amber and... Yes indeed it is the jewel of Jaipur and one place which I always wanted to see through my camera and eyes. It stands mighty in the midst of Jaipur and you can occasionally view this magnificent monument whenever you pass by or on your... nice reflections. thats about it! view it from the road- but stop will be alongside busses and tourist cars.  dont know if there is anway to access it. dont think so. pretty, but not as pretty as lake palace in udaipur. You pass the Jah Mahal going to Amber and it is worth a stop because it looks very romantic especiallt in the morning when it seems to float on the mist but you can't go in so it isn't woth a special trip We only stopped briefly to look at this palace across the lake. It sdoes make a nice photo opportunity biut there is no access to the palace. While the whole monument itself looks nice from far, there was no access to the monument and its a shame, giving access to the place would give a different touch than just watching it from far Its good to photograph in morning and during sunset.
Nothing much to do here.Its on the way to amer and jaighar fort. This is a nice stop on your way to the Amber Fort. Catch it as the sun is rising for some wonderful backlit photos. We have been here a couple times and it has become a family challenge to capture the best shot. Try it... this place is much away from the rushed streets of modern jaipur..
it provide peace of mind .
during winter months you can get glimpse of Siberian birds, who choose it as foreign habitat  in their odd native climates.. Jal Mahal  is a palace located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city,It is considered an architectural beauty built in the Rajput and Mughal styles of architecture  providing a picturesque view of the lake (from the Mansagar dam on the eastern... Have to see only standing on the shore of the river... Boating around this should have made the visit to this mahal great,but not available Not visisted on many of the tours but depending on where your accomodationis you practically have to drive past it if your going to the fort. Keep youe eyes open and get you tuk tuk, rickshaw or minibus to stop. Beautiful photo opportunity as the... Stunning views from far but no organized tours to get closer! Great photo opportunity on the way to Fort! We saw this on our way to Amer Fort, nothing special about this. It would be nicer if there is a boat service from the main road side.. What you can see is a palace standing midst of a water body. There is no provision to reach to that palace. Hence only a distant view is available.
You can feed fishes as some vendors sell wheat flour for this purpose. If you are... Not allowed to go in.  Can see from the main road.  Part of the monuments from the Jaipur Kingdom era. as much as it seems fascinating, its doesn't feel like one until you don't get to see it close by and from inside. you can just see it from the road about 300 ft. its kinda cool to think about it though if you have...

It's on the left side of the road as you return from the... This is only good to photograph fairly late in the afternoon.  You can't go to it.  Perhaps it will be a lot more interesting if it is converted into a useable facility, such as a restaurant. Jal Mahal is a very interesting place. One should ensue to visit the place if you are planning to got Jaipur. The Best time to visit the place is around sun set. During the sun set time, one can see the Jal mahal with lights.... The Jal Mahal is good for a photo op and a camel ride. Can spend 30-45 minutes, especially if you have kids who are clamoring for a camel ride. Unfortunately, I can't go in to. I just saw it from the distance. It is nice when the dark comes and the lights are on. It is in the middle of the lake, make its reflection is really nice. :)) there are many hotels near this place if you stay there you can enjoy morning and evening walk infront of the jalmahal road This is a beautiful palace located right in the center of a lake.

When I visited the place, there was no entry to the Mahal built in the middle of the water. All I could do was to click the view from the garden. This is a place worth visiting again. jal mahal is just a building in the middle of a lake . unfortunately ur not allowed to go near it by boat ..so its just a distant view of the building . But wat i found intersting was that some guides at that spot... On the way to or while returning from amber fort, can get down here.
This was constructed before dam was built. Hence the building now in the middle of lake.
Three floors are situated below water.
Good photographic background.
Nice to walk by the side... Something different but also something similar, a nice place during summer to avoid the heat. Tripura Maharaja has also made the same in Udaipur, Tripura, named Nirmahal. Natural Aircooler. Not really accessible. Just a view from the far bank. Hounded by vendors and photographers. Since it is located on the way from Amer to the city, a short stop is worth it. this was built by kind with a small fort between water the architecture is again different...the view et all. the environment is rustic and tradional. It makes you go back in history and think how things would have been earlier..how people used to live etc Stop the car and take a photo, that is the extent of the experience. You can add to the experience by running the gauntlet of the people selling the usual tourist tat. We passed the Jal Mahal a few times and it was these differences... I was told by my taxi driver that we can not go inside the monuments. We can just see from the pond side. I feel Government should maintain it in a proper way. With proper lighting & painting, this could be made a evening happening... Best spot to take à photo is om the way up to Fort Jaeger!  It is something to look at and take a picture at, so the visit doesn't tak long! nothing special about it.
But it can be used as timeout to stretch your body after a tiring trip of amber fort.
Just step out of your vehicle walk to the lake take some snaps, eat some street food, etc.

It became quite hot and we just wanted to visit and get back. Hence didnt take a guide. Taking someone along would really be worth it. Beautiful and fascinating. Well maintained and amazing to know how... Interesting place – our guide showed us around explaining how all the instruments work.  I would not go out of my way for a standalone visit here, but if you are nearby visiting other attractions then worth a stop off.

It is a great place to wander around for an hour on a hot day, just wondering at the measurements and observations that must have been taken here in its heyday.
A good point... What a thoroughly interesting place. The instruments are visually impressive and even more mind boggling when clearly and intelligently explained by the brilliant English speaking guide. Don’t scrimp - get a guide inside. They are authorised and totally worth the small fee. We gladly tipped... If you are visiting, make sure you go with a guide. It is quite interesting but if you are running out of time, you can give this a miss. I'm an amateur astronomer so I wished I could have spent more time figuring out how all these structures worked.

The way they tell you time till the minute is amazing..

Hiring a guide is a must.

Jantar mantar is most fascinating and very precise monument of jaipur . It gives exact position of sun and moon and all planets of solar system.
But you should have a tourist guide with you to explain all the instruments . You will be amazed by this place. This is a perfect example of hundreds of year of Indian Ancient Science example. Keep a guide while visiting this place. It's an impressive place. 
The instruments used to calculate time, star and moon signs are something to be checked out. 

If possible, you can take your ""flat earth"" friend and make him goes bananas on trying to defend his theory lol Incredible place - mind boggling how they found out how to tell the time so accurately all those centuries ago! You won't need more than 45 minutes to visit unless you're eally hooked on astrology and time. This was more interesting than I thought it was going to be, so I was pleasantly surprised. We had a guide, which I think was a help. We were grateful for the shade of the trees as it was rather hot. Not much here for... I don't believe I've ever seem a more dramatic and accurate set of time measuring devices from small to extremely large.  It's well worth the visit.

Jantar Mantar is located in Jaipur. Here one can see the astonomical items present and how they work with the sun and time. This is an impressive observatory which dates back way earlier than I had every expected such accuracy was available.
You will only need an hour particularly on a hot day as there is little space to find shade and can get very hot. Use a... We had no idea what we were seeing, but, it was fascinating !

Very big instrument to calculate time with the shadow.must visit place .

Would make the visit more interesting and... This observatory was well worth the visit, to think that it was designed and constructed in 1726AD and was so accurate and useful to the Mughal is fantastic. A pleasant and peaceful place to escape for an hour Brilliant. Mind boggling. Well worth seeing
Can certainly reccomend a visit. Our guide by Regal Vacations was very informative It is interesting to see all the astronomical features at this sight built so many years ago. It is worth getting a guide sheet or guide to explain some of the instruments.  We could not believe how big and accurate these instruments are Cool place. Neat to see how the sun dails work. Impressive they made all this so long ago. Worth a visit! Most interesting array of huge astrology tools built up. The amount of detail in how calculations were and still are performed is stunning - don't expect to learn how this all works. But that these tools built by a Maharadja hundreds of years ago still... A visit early in the day will help avoid the tourist crush. Worth going to the Interpretation centre for a 10min AV explanation of the observatory. 
Buy a composite ticket if you're planning on vsiting several sites in Jaipur for 1000 rupees (excludes City Palace) Very nice although you probably need an audio guide to understand how all things are working. Fresh water little store which was very welcomed with the heat that day This place is incredible and gives you an insight into how our ancestors were brilliant people without any technology at their disposal.

Its a good place to take children along so that they can understand how things work in astronomy and zodiac. Good place to visit with young kids. Attractive place for tourists. But in summer days when temperature goes high one should avoid to visit The Jantar Mantar is a collection of nineteen astrological instruments constructed by a Raiput King in the early 1700s....still highly accurate for telling time.  Primary among these instruments is the world's largest stone sun dial.  This site was damaged in the 1800s but was wonderfully... Didn't know about this site before we left on our Golden triangle tour. Travel broadens the mind. Great to see the scale of this observatory built in 1734. The accuracy and the size of the astronomical instruments without the use of computers etc. The worlds...

Not much to see or do,those interested in astronomy and medieval time clocks would find the visit worthwhile ! The refreshment stall attached, is very reasonably priced ! We were amazed by the level of sophistication and precision of these massive pieces of astrological equipment manufactured centuries before the advent of computers, calculators and modern tools.

Another of the sites on the list see list. We loved this place. It is described as an observatory but in fact is a place where you observe time, space, seasons etc. Especially impressive of course is the worlds largest sundial, accurate to half a second. If you visit Jaipur you must visit this... The vision of the 16th century Maharah who built this was amazing, it is the most spectacular place and the astronomical monuments are astonishing in their scale and accuracy. This is a must see attraction One word. AMAZING. How this was built, all those years ago. Though the day, was overcast. Our guide, explained how the different, time pieces worked. And, his knowledge of the monuments, we saw in JAIPUR, excellent. We called him, God😊 One small criticism, he spoke...

A high point of any visit to... Must visit place if you travel to Jaipur what a marvel of architecture and science in 1700 very well thought of and placing as well without any computers genius work.

If you want visit Jaipur city  in 1 day then.
Start with Jantar mantra as... I can tell that's very clever of the people in the past that they established them for time shown. It could show time, month, year, and horoscope. They could utilized both sun and moon. Take a look! Unbelievable how men could do such things!
Your guide yussouf was very professional and gave us all the informations concerning this site I was really surprised 🤨 to see such a great architects' designs of several sun dials. What you find is all varieties of Sun Dials which show the time with Precision perfect. It's not a great thing nowadays with the advancement of technology and information... Great Astronomical wonder made my Maharaja of Jaipur.

Recommended to take Guide as he can explain well.

Next to city palace and is a must visit It is adjacent to City Palace Jaipur, another landmark historic place in Jaipur. You, however, can enjoy it fully only if you have some preliminary knowledge of astronomy or astronomy instruments. However, the second best option is to have a guide who are available in... Bigger then Delhi jantar Mantar fascinating place without a guide you wouldn't understand any of it so take someone knowledgeable! Whilst this place wasn't everyone on our tours favourite, it is well worth a visit and the astrologers and mathematicians among us found it truly fascinating.  There is also quite a bit to see outside with market stalls and snake charmers nearby. Quite bigger then Delhi one's.
Nahargarh fort is visible from here.
Different instruments which were used in history to study astronomy are built here. One AV room is there which gives info about all the instruments. had high hopes of this area for photography purposes, but quickly realised the observatory is definitely not in its former glory as internet posts & blogs suggest. many of the structures are falling down, requiring immediate maintenance. there are fences around most things making for... Jaipur is a wonderful city full of historical monuments and well worth a visit. Perhaps the most interesting for those of a more scientific mind is Jantar Mantar. Fascinating and inform
ative to see how mathematically advanced India was in the  early 18th century. A... The site is fascinating.The 19 astronomical instruments are very eye catching and aesthetically pleasing.The technical details of star gazing and taking the time are interesting but the pretty venue is lovely. Pink city, Jaipur. Really nice place. My recommendation is that you have to visit Jantar Mantar. Ticket is 200 rupees for foreigners. We had a full tour, including a description of every item by someone who was clearly besotted by them.  They did not mean much to me, particularly the astrological items, although I could appreciate the largest sundial in the world.  If you have spare time... Opposite the City Palace in Jaipur, this is the Royal Observatory.  There are 19 astronomical instruments located here, including the world’s largest stone sundial.  Amazing place to visit considering it was all hand made. Wastage of time and money.. Delhi's Jantar Mantar is much better.
The Jaipur one does not have any bhool bhulaiya. A must to visit, most intriguing place of science and precision. Go with a guide so that everything will make sense. Built in the 1700 to enable accurate time of birth to be plotted and able to correctly tell the time within 2 seconds. Essential to pay for a guided tour else a lot will be missed in understanding the various pieces and what they were... This is a must see attraction in Jaipur if you have kids in 6-12 age group. The instruments have decent description of purpose and working. The best one was where you can make out time by looking at the sun shadow on the instrument. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site as has the world’s largest stone sun dial in its midst.  The site has a collection of nineteen astronomical instruments built in 1734 by a Rajput king measuring time and longitudes and calculating astrological and astronomical movements.  There... Most amazing instruments for both astronomy
and astrology ,built here few centuries ago
everything is accurate ( this giant instruments)
and show how one man’s idea can be matherialized if one have funds and will.
   Worth visiting! I would rather suggest to take a narrator while visiting this place because for normal people who do not know a, b, c about time and science it will be difficult to understand. This architecture shows how India excelled in time and planets forecast. Who’d have thought that this was built in the 1700’s, that’s what amazed me most. The site has the biggest stone sun dial in the world and our guide told us the exact time of day on the smaller one ... amazing. There are several... I love astronomy so really enjoyed this place.

We had a guide - we were with a tour group and it was included - and that made it more understandable, however he only explained about half the instruments in the complex. Amazing how the ancients figured out time keeping! 

Jantar Mantar Jaipur is well maintained, and one can spend an hour or so in the midst of a busy Jaipur itinerary in Jaipur - and for sure, don't miss the Jantar! I was going to tell our guide we wanted to skip this place as I just thought it was a place with a telescope and who wants to see a telescope in the middle of the afternoon. Well this is anything but a telescope. I... The guy who designed this place was very clever.  I didnt understand all of it but it was still worth a visit. Fascinating array of astronomical/astrological devices, installed (and many invented) by Jai Singh in mid 1700's. Spacious layout but little shade- can get very hot. Audio guide not worth having- print on screen tiny and impossible to read in bright sunlight. Same price as human guide-... Interesting visit...amazed at the advanced instruments. Good place to bring teens and family for discovery of solar system tracking. Had no idea how many different types of sun dials there are for measuring the time. Our guide explaining each in detail. There is even a horoscope one! 
Entrance for tourists is about triple of the local fare. All entrance fees go to the Marharga.... Given this  was created a number of centuries ago it is incredible how this observatory was created and built with so much accuracy even by today's standards and technology. 

The structures them selves are also very beautiful Really wonderful and amazing to see that people of that era had such skills that whole astrological data is displayed using unconventional techniques and without the resources and technology which we have today. A must see This place really educated us. We never realised that Indian's led their lives around their horoscopes.

To know how advanced people were back in days in astronomy, this place is a must visit. I loved the science behind it. Worth seeing but our guide was obviously a fan and went into huge detail. But without doubt the technical issues of 18th century astronomy are magnificent. Just that unless you are an afficionado you can only take so much before your brain caves in! But... Hangar Mantar is one of superb place in Jaipur. You can visit with family, friends or even solo. Loved it!!! This place is fascinating if you're interested in how things work and good old fashioned science.

This is truly a marvel and gem of locarion. You are lefrt stunned after seeing the kind of scientific learnings we had. Lovely visit , great for taking amazing photos. 
It's a must when in Jaipur. 
We had a driver who took us from a to b. This is a testament to the creative minds of this part of the world just st under 300 years ago.

Astonishing to realise that it was completed in 1734 and features the world's largest stone sundial, which is said to be accurate to 2 seconds!  There is a tourist information centre down on the left... This astronomical observatory can tell the time with an accuracy of 2 seconds using the largest stone sundial in the world. If this wasn’t sufficiently impressive the split marble hemispheres giant astrolobe and other sighting structures are. Indian ingenuity from the past at its best. You need a guide to explain what everything is and how it works, to fully understand all of the instruments.  But its well worth it. One of the highlights in Jaipur. We visited this place as part of our tour with Citrus Holidays. Our guide told us that this intreaguing place was built to enable accuracy in time and birth plotting and has been confirmed as being accurate within a couple of seconds Jantar Mantar

In The City Center,  Near City Palace,

One of The fascinating astronomical observatory , set of some 20 main fixed instruments.  Designed for the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye, they embody several architectural and instrumental innovations. This is the most... The observatory - the biggest in the world - was created by an astronomer-king in the 18th century to measure everything from altitude to time, and map the movement of the planets and the stars. And it is truly amazing how accurate those measurements were,... This place have the scientific method to identify time and it is one of its kind in India. Must recommend to see all the historic measuring method. One the best historical places in jaipur to visit and also a different one because it seems to ahead of its time when it was build, you can hire a guide to make sure you understand about the place as much as you can cause... Perhaps this rating isn’t really fair on my part as I guess I’m just not an advocate for astrology. The instruments are interesting but then the scientific credibility of the place is undermined with their fortune telling. We visited with a group and were invited... This site consists of a collection of 19 huge stone astronomical instruments, including the worlds biggest sundial, built between 1728 and 1734. Most of these are the among the biggest instruments ever built. We had a guide who made our visit much more understandable. This place is quite fascinating, I suggest hiring a guide to explain the different buildings and sites. Beautiful structures and well maintained. Jantar Mantar is one of 5 observatries designed and built by ancient Jaipur royalty. Using the supersize instruments you can accurately work out time of day, position of stars etc. Well worth a visit to understand how advanced Indian culture was at that time. Interesting site.  We had a guide who explained the functioning of the different instruments and it was quite fascinating.  Very hot here, as site provides little cover, and the sun in Jaipur is relentless, best to visit in the morning. Really very interesting guided tour and lots to touch and photo and opposite the city palace. Worth a trip The visit to this ""astronomical"" park offers the opportunity to learn more about the relationship of the Indian population with astrology. The park is full of imposing and curious constructions that relate celestial phenomena with the facts and events of everyday life. Felt kind of like a sculpture garden tbh, but with mathematical and scientific significance. It was a pretty place though, and quieter than the chaotic city outside. The explanation signs were a bit boring. We had more fun just going to whichever of the instruments... This astrological and astronomical wonder is pretty cool.
If you have a guide to explain all the instruments, it's really quite fascinating.
Might be pretty hard to navigate it on your own and get the true feel for the place.
Think the maharajah who put... Built in the 1720s it is absolutely amazing to see the accuracy with which the various instruments can predict time,zodiac signs,position of stars and constellations.The changes of position of sun and the moon during the year have been taken into account for the calibration.....the time... You really need a guide here to explain exactly how the sundials calculates the time. We were lucky that ours knew all the history and showed how exact these timepieces are. Not an essential place to visit. The is ancient marvel and proof that how advance were people in early days. Home of many astronomical instruments. We were fortunate in having a sunny day to visit this observatory with so many sundials and moon dials from the past in action. our guide explained what we were looking at and we could see the sun moving over the second hands of various... We deferred our visit here as the originally planned day was too cloudy (we went to the Amber Fort instead), but the morning that we went instead the sun cooperated fully, allowing us to get to see all of the amazing ‘instruments’ working. It is... If you have limited time then don't spend more then 15 minutes here. I got nothing here, but architecture is just one point of view. The way it is built is just good. But of a word place that didn't really have enough explanations about what was going on.
Lots of stone structures that seemed to be various types of sundials.
Not recommended. It's hard to believe that these were built 300 years ago.
And to see a sun dial that gives you the time down to the minute # Mindblowing We stopped of here for an hour. It’s amazing how this level of accuracy and complexity was achieved so many years ago. We went in the afternoon and it was very hot with no shade so would recommend for the early or later part of... Wow!!  Didn't expect this.  Something Orson Wells, Jules Verne, George Lucas, Newton, etc., could have dreamed up - but this was real - an 18th C Observatory that somehow wasn't damaged or destroyed in all this time.  Each piece  (Machinery, astronomical creations, mathematical revelation???) Were... To those who are interested in astronomy and ancient charting, this place is a haven. However, if you're just passing by, looking for stuff to do, you can pass it by. It would be great if it was free, but it's not, and we didn't... The place is interesting that even in ancient times, their knowledge of astronomy was quite impressive.  The world's largest sundial is here.
You cannot climb on monuments but just look at it from a distance.
You won't spend too much time here Must visit place for all people.. very impressed by all the equipment and sheer sizes and explanations of what and how the kings of ancient India invested in science and understanding of space..very educative and wonderful to walk through and admire how they calculated  when... This Jantar Mantar is the biggest and best of the five in India. (We visited the one in Delhi and it is smaller and in much worse shape)
We had a guide who was able to explain how each component worked and what it was... Very beautiful place. Ao much to know about this place.  Must visit with kids and family. Hire a local guide there to know about detailed history. This is one where you definitely need a guide who knows what they’re talking about otherwise is just a collection on large scale instruments.  Including the worlds largest sundial it’s incredible to think that the scientists of the day were able to work all this... A truly amazing place.   From the worlds biggest clock (okay it's actually the worlds biggest sundial) to other astrological devices, this attraction is awe inspiring.   Imagine what the ancient builders of this place could have done if they had computers or modern machinery. No sun, no fun as this is outdoors and all the ‘instruments’ bar one requires shadows to tell the time. The only instrument as far as I learned not needing sun was the north or pole star locator.

Worth a visit if you’re going to... Out of the five Jantar Mantar s in India only this one is fully operational and accurate up to 2 seconds. A special treat for astrology and mathematics scholars. Being built last of the five all the errors drawbacks of earlier one are rectified here... Very good historical site to see. Particularly for people who wants to understand celestial objects/measurements and interested in a piece of history. Well maintained and very clean. Located in the centre of the city. Worth the visit. You will appreciate the greatness of Indian glory. The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur, built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II, is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments.  The word Jantra is derived from yantra, instrument, while Mantar is derived from mantrana meaning consult or calculate. The primary purpose of the... You must visit with a well educated & informed guide. Very well preserved sight in Jaipur. A structure built for beyond its time. I could spend hours there & learn more & more. Enjoyed my quick stop at the gift shop. Lovely notebooks & fridge... Jantar Mantar has sun dial to calculate time and other stone structures that help us to state the positions of various celestial bodies. It would be good to hire a guide or read about the instruments well before entering. The place is very clean. Historical site that shows different types of celestial measuring devices to measure the stars and time and place of that town. Measuring devices that are huge are actually accurate it's so fascinating to see how much science was used back then. Very family-friendly area outside... Imagine a king having such a vision to get such an observatory constructed in older times. There are 12 structures each for a zodiac sign. The sun dial is accurate and while walking the area you get to know the mindset of a king who... This was far more interesting than we thought it was going to be, really worth visiting. Amazing how it was built, fascinating. If time is limited would skip this attraction. There is really not a whole lot to see after the first sun dial. Signage doesn’t provided too much information about the astrological instruments. A must see place if you’re visiting here. The scientific analysis of time is both intriguing and accurate. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience! On first glance, this may look like a sculpture park with bold stone installations, pointing to the sky. Although the stones are pointing skywards, their purposes are more astronomical than sculptural!
This is a real, but painless, education-you’ve got to go! a worth visiting place for a tourist to Jaipur ; It helps a person how the Time was evolved an educative visit for Students of School and College , Very Informative so also relaxing after the Palace Trip. No idea what to expect when we walked in here. Turned out to be quite an academic revelation but my wife and I both got caught up in all the astrology and had a very enjoyable tour round this place.

Not top of my list... It is a bit geeky but it is fascinating. Some fantastic sun dials the biggest of which must be more than 10m high and can be as accurate a 2seconds ! You can literally watch time slip by. 

Well worth a trip even for non... very interesting experience . Built to tel time of the day , seasons , position of the planets and constellations using the shadow of the sun on a sundial method. Use a knowledgeable guide who is not rushing you to understand how it works. If you are into astrology and metrology, then this place is for you.  We were shown and explained thoroughly by our private guide. Here is a place where architecture meets science. Still accurate time keeping structures dominate the landscape providing precise ascension and declinations of the sun ☀. Created hundreds of years ago and still very accurate to this day. Well worth a look. In the era of very high commuting powers in the hands of everyone, the 250 years old Jantar Mantar comes as a truly amazing and almost mesmerising display of human genius. The way the precise calculations can be carried out by following simple mathematical formulas... most of the information tiles are broken, entries to view and calculate are blocked, only can see from outside.. Built as a a scientific experiment to measure time and stars at a time when little was known about the subject. To Hindus reading your stars is important even today. You do not complete an arranged marriage without knowing you are star compatible. Incredible 300 year old construction with many sundials - a variety of functions, including winter/summer angles, largest you'll ever see - accurate to 2 seconds, and 1 for each sign of the zodiac. Science at full scale. If you believe in astro, sung signs etc etc

Lovely place to learn about the universe and position of stars moon and sun. Guide explained very nicely Unbelievable architecture. Most scientific structures cannot match these wonderful creations. Dated back to centuries. Very interesting and knowledgeable. Hire a government approved guide or a headphone.

Jantar Mantar, collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II almost 300 yrs ago, it's a UNESCO World Heritage site, located near city palace. Need a guide to understand how the structures work from astronomy point of view. You must get one of their guides. If we had walked round on our own we would have had no idea what we were looking at. You pick up one of the guides from the gate for 300 rupees. Our guy was so knowledgeable and... Like a giant playground this observatory has to be seen to be believed. Suitable for everyone over the age of 5, it offers a great reminder of our school lessons. Be sure to get a guide to explain everything and be amazed! We enjoyed every bit of this wonderful landmark.

It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is located... We love this place. OK so the explanations aren't brilliant but just think about what they could do with these instruments... it's quite amazing even in the abstract.

And, if you can't appreciate the charts and astronomy, then just look at it as superb sculpture.... The Jantar Mantar is in fact an observatory of olden days built by the Maharaja of Jaipur.

The cost of a guide is INR 200 so beware of people asking for more. The guides themselves are... Had seen this on television, but in reality it is stunning.  The mind of someone who can design something like this is unimaginable.  We had a wonderful guide who explained the way everything works and so we were able to really understand it.

It is especially impressive because of its age (early 18th century) and astrological focus at such... We thought the Jantar Mantar was very interesting especially as we were provided explanations of each of the different clocks by our guide. Quite impressive.

The place reminds the advances India had in Astronomy and Mathematics hundreds of years back over other regions !

It is really amazing the instruments and structures made to study astronomy so many centuries back.

Lots of calculations to keep even the most sophisticated scientific type amused

This place is definitely not like other palace..it has 19 architectural astronomical instruments.. liked it.. We had a guide, but the visit was too rushed, the explanations too perfunctory and there was just too much to take in during the short amount of time that I spent there. Jantar Mantar was definitely worth a visit. The only unfortunate thing was taking a guide. We paid 200 Rs, which is a fixed price, and the explanations were not interesting and very short.  So it is not worth even 50 Rs honestly.. Better read more... Have been there before some month , u can find some beautiful monument and sculpture there. A great attraction to foreigners and one of best thing in capital city of Rajasthan First thing- take guide. you need a knowledgeable person to fully appreciate the instruments...

The amateur astronomer in me found it interesting: the interest in architecture side of me found it interesting: the artist in me found it interesting: the photographer in me... Imagine.

This attraction is usually packaged with a tour of the City Palace next door. The accuracy of... Amazing to see what the King in the 1700’s built to understand time, planet positioning and astronomy.  Interesting and educational. This place was fascinating, both for the level of astronomical knowledge when it was constructed to the durability of the construction.

We heard a lot about it and find it superb.It was made in 18th century and amazed how smart and knowledgable king who was also know as astronomer and who built Jaipur City based on Astronomy and Vastu. The astronomical instruments look quite cool from a distance, but inside there's little information to explain their significance or how they work. Perhaps we should have paid a guide, but I would probably skip this one. Thanks to Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II , India has 5 Jantar Mantar across different cities - Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, Varanasi and Mathura. Jaipur, being the biggest one. 

This place is home to worlds largest Sundial - Samrat Yantra. 

Would definitely recommend a guided tour... Very much of the same thing. A couple sun dails and things used to determine time and such things.

While I don't have a particular interest in astrology I could appreciate the science behind the structures especially when you consider when they were built.  I think you need a guide though who is able... By far it is very well maintained than that of new delhi’s and other jantarmantars. A guide is recommended otherwise you will not understand anything about the instruments. A must see place in jaipur. Various structures that basically work out the time based upon where the sun is.
Not only time but date and astrology sign.
Considering how old this is it's amazing how accurate it is. Accurate to 2 (TWO) seconds. One of the more intriguing sites to visit in Jaipur.

Please ensure that you hire a guide. City palace , Jantar Mantar n Hawa Mahal are close to each other.. walking distance. Fascinating if you like a bit of science - how they created these large astronomical instruments centuries ago that survive to this day. We were lucky enough to have a guide who explained it all to us otherwise we’d have been a bit lost. Unless you are into astronomy, I'd give it a miss. The grounds are perfectly kept and its a peaceful garden, but, I was disappointed. One more reason to be proud to be Indian - bhartia 
The accuracy with with the astonnoners have made the tools in those days with less resources is remarkable. A must visit We were a little worried this would be a Boring attraction but were absolutely fascinated and enthralled by the observatory. It was so mind provoking and educational and we all agreed one of the best places visited on our tour. Get awed by the knowledge of the ancient scientists. You get to see the tools they used for celestial studies and horography.
Must visit if you are in Jaipur The Jantar Mantar Observatory is truly exceptional showing the mystery in physics and mathematics.

Without this you would just wander around not understanding the significance of why the place was built and why the concept of horoscopes in India is so important with regards to everything from where you live to who you marry. Right in the centre of Jaipur this is a collection of large astronomical instruments, it seems mainly for the purpose of tell the time and calculating birth dates and times to prepare horoscopes, rather than any serious research. It's like a garden of instruments including... If you like astronomy you'll love visiting this historical site but even if you aren't its just an amazing place to go and have a roam around.  This site was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, dating back to the 1700`s it just... A delight to the eyes, a scientific and cultural experience worth viewing...Truly a must watch.

Nice place I visited during my india trip Visiting Jantar Mantar, we felt under the historical tunnel to understand how time to be marked. With the undevelopped science as we are now, time is divided in accordance to the movement of the sun. 

The precision of the simple devices is really tremendously surprising.... Impressive astronomic observatory , built by a Marahja that realy liked science , astronomy and astrology . There are many stone devices from different times shown here the main object the sundial was huge and nice. the accuracy is up to 2 seconds.

Every student of science should visit this place those who got inclination towards astronomy. Superb is that still maintained well. Special mention needs to time devices orSuryaghari.

This is an attraction that I highly recommend, it was enjoyed hugely by both the men and the woman in our group. Do not miss. Lovely peaceful setting with some quiet shady spots to take a breather!

Jantar Mantar was a really strong testimony of how strong science and culture were prevalent during the time of royal history. There is actual equipment from the history however the place has not been maintained. It  is  truly  amazing  to  know  and  see that  our  ancestors were such great  astrophysics experts  without  the  help  of  super computers. The  traditional  telescope is  a case  in  point. The  methods  of  determining  the  palnetary  positions, measuring  the distances from  earth ..etc  are really... For those interested in the historical and astronomical measurements using sundials and other structures this will be interesting and probably better than a score of three. 
I recommend paying the 200rp for a guide so you get the background and function of the various pieces.... Put Indian science and civilisation into some context with a visit to this extraordinary science park from the 1700. The worlds largest sundial , accurate to 2 seconds is quite something.

When I visited the famous Jantar Mantar in Jaipur, I couldn't believe it was built ages ago. The shear accuracy with which every instrument, disguised as a grand monument in itlself, measures... No, it's not just a living representation of the Salavador Dali painting that had clocks melting off of tree branches. These are ancient precision instruments that measure the movements of the planets.  
The large sundial (again, just looks like an incredible sculpture) measures the time... The size and complexity of the astronomical structures here is mind boggling, not to mention accuracy. Take a pre-booked guide as I would have been at a loss just visiting. We were lucky enough to have a guide provided with our tour. I believe there may also be audio guides available.
This is one of the attractions in Jaipur that I feel was well worth visiting. One of best jantar Mantar in India. Lot of large scaled scientific projects are available for display. Quite a big place so if you are short of time, choose best of your interest. The Jantar Mantar is a place which we have seen in our text books many times. Must show to kids, it is an engineering Marvel. Simply an outstanding and unique treasure. An insight into how scientific 18th century India was. In addition beautiful shapes to admire. Recommended Sun dials are common but Jantar Mantar being the largest (or probably near) of its kind is really magnificent. You can just stand there and awe at the scientific marvel. A pretty accurate way to calculate the motion of celestial bodies & zodiac signs. A place unique and interesting at the same time. One feels that was built out of its own time. Not a match with all the palaces an attractions in India. a place worth a visit if you are travelling to Jaipur.
Recommended to take a guide to understand the technology used UNESCO preserved World Heritage site should be in one's list of must see places in Jaipur trip. The amazing way in which precision tracking of the motion of celestial bodies & zodiac signs as well as the most accurate sun dials until then that were... What a way they had to find out time, altitude of earth, Rashi for names for children, etc.
Al this with the help of Sun. At first glance it does not look impressive, but once you go up close and the guide starts to explain each Jantar Mantar's specialized function for astronomical measurement you will be amazed especially because these instruments still work!

This is definitely worth a visit in... This is probably worth doing when in the pink city area at the same time as city palace and hawa Mahal. It is 200 each for a foreign person to enter and can walk around for 20 30 mins max. The locals I was traveling with wanted me to go but the description sounded kind of boring to me.  I was so wrong.  It was absolutely fascinating.  The advanced technology and precision from centuries ago was astounding.  And, you don't need to be a genius... The whole thing is just amazing, to think that the 'instruments' are all made from stone of some sort and yet have provided accuracy of 2 seconds is unreal. We could only marvel at it all, a true 'must see'! Jantar manta nice place and beautiful place in jaipur city . when I see this place feeling so good and feeling crazy. Amazing sights especially if you follow astrology.

Yet another of India’s world heritage sites.

You can check the position of the constellations and check the time all using 17th century structures that are time accurate to within 20 seconds today! We found this tour absolutely fascinating, our guide explained everything to us very clearly so to think of this place being built so long ago with the accuracy of the information you can glean is staggering.

It was built by save Jai Singh, very accurate and still operational, you need to hire a guide to understand all the astronomical instruments. We went with family for holidays there...nice place in Jaipur ... historical ..a very unique way to know the time ...very smart Kings of those times... Amazing place. Walk amongst all the devices designed to calculate all sorts of things - worlds biggest sundial etc. As most devices rely on sunshine there is NO SHADE so make sure you take your hat and some water. If one has already seen Jantar Mantar in Delhi, this can be skipped or you can check it from outside; else its worth a visit specially with small kids; Its inside the city palace campus; For me this was a fascinating look at astronomy and astrology and how it was down in the 1700s. My husband was a bit dubious at first but even he enjoyed looking at the instruments. 
One of the real fascinations is the size! Bigger scale... I wish I had done a bit of research on this site of nineteen astrological instruments! These are truly amazing to see in person! So intricate, so intriguing, so futuristic,  how did they figure this out? Excellent place to show our ancestor lean towards science. Take help of guide to understand the structures here. Many people spend in taking selfie and photos than understanding the science. The Video and Audio facility is excellent but does not have generator backup. This place is worth a visit If you are into maths, sundials and astrology. Otherwise it’s a place full of weird sculptures! The secret room entry fees is very expensive. But as we've seen a lot of its photo so we decide to pay to entry fees. The entry fees is including one guilde and it take 1.30 hrs for the tour, I would suggest if you... We were amazed to see that the instruments there are all highly technical in nature. As a student of geography we couldn't even imagine that we have done as much progress.
All students and schools should plan one trip of jantar mantar. We were in jaipur for a meeting and we had few hours to pass before we had to catch the flight there for we booked a cab in Marriott hotel to have a quick visit to Jantar Mantar
We were ushered into a room where... After you visited the City Palace it's worth to pay a visit to this interesting outdoors astronomical observatory. 
There's audio guide available for 200 rupees pp /on top of the entrance fee/. This place is interesting.
It's in front of the City Palace.
Not very big place, need someone to explain as there is not much explanation. This is a nice place well in the city of Jaipur with a good garden. Evenings are the best time to visit but sadly the place closed by around 5pm. Without guide, it may be difficult for you to understand about this place. Better take audio/personal guide to know better. Jantar Mantar was made by the erstwhile Maharaja of Jaipur.He was known as an astronomer,poet,thinker.
He also constructed similar structure in Delhi.It is difficult to comprehend how people a few hundred or so ago visualised and executed such projects.The sun dials that are almost precisely... Here you can find huge structures which used as scientific measurements. Architectural astronomical instrument made in centuries ago in India to find the positions of the stars, this shows how Indians were advanced in their field.

It’s not somewhere you spend hours - 30 mins should do it - but it is... We had a tour guide that showed us each instrument and what it did.

Just wondering how intelligent the king was.
he took special interest in studying as well as implementing astronomy. Nice place. One Must visit the video introductory part to understand better. it's better to check the introductory before then checking the instruments. Absolutely amazing space. Some basics in astronomy would be helpful to better understand the instruments here. You cannot climb or properly observe most of them but those you can access would require some help to decode. I would recommend taking a personal guide here. This is a fascinating historical site that includes the world's largest sundial and gnomon. The sundial is amazingly accurate. Check the time indicated against your watch! This is just beside the Royal Palace. There is an entrance fee on this museum and lots of early astrological concepts.

Nice to see structures of size and are quite beautiful as well, but will be better on a sunny day as shadows are the point of the instruments in the facility. Jantar Mantar, and with a guide will always be a memorable visit.  The guide because, we think we know a lot about astronomy, but we can be so dumbfounded in absence of one!  

We happened to be there on a pleasant sunny day.  Sun is... So, what rings in your mind when you hear this word Jantar Mantar? Something mysterious… magical…isn’t it?

Amazing accuracy for its time period! I’m not a scientist but found these structures to be extraordinary. Without a knowledgable guide we wouldn’t have found out even 10% of how Jantar Mantar works. Very worthwhile visiting but only with a guide who can lead you through how each instrument works. Fascinating place. Nicely planned but people don't understand the meaning behind it so easily, information is less and very hot outside. Again everywhere tickets are there in Jaipur. For ticket rate, it is not so worthy. From looking at Jantar Mantar photo, I was prepare to be disappointed. This place is actually wow me in so many ways.

Love seeing and know places of jaipur 💗 Jantar mantar observatory in Jaipur is a wonderful blend of Indian science as well as mathematics.even though there are people highly knowledgeable when they see the observatory they just say wow...not a single word to explain what exactly it is.... whenever you have a chance... We were not sure what to expect with the visit to the Royal Observatory / Jantar Mantar. It is where Astronomy and Astrology meet. Considering the age of the observatory (which is all outdoors and relies on the sun for its numerous readings), it is... Interesting structures but unless you have a guide who is able to describe each apparatus and the mathematical principals behind them you will essentially be looking at bizarre shapes!

Not really worth the money but if you have time after visiting the palace then it... We had no idea what to expect when we saw this place on the itinerary but what a fascinating experience. The various astrological and more scientific instruments are all really interesting and the scale is quite unexpected. Open air observatory with outsized instruments used to measure the time, movement of planets but also with an astrological element as the zodiac is used to assist making compatible marriage partners in India. Home of the world's biggest sun dial and fascinating to see how... Good insight into the maths and physics skills of the time. Lots of interesting instruments, get the audio tour. Jantar mantar was developed by Sawai Jai Singh - erstwhile ruler of Jaipur who had an interest in astronomy. Of the 5 such observatories he constructed (including one in Delhi) this one is in the best condition.

You can see the sun-dials and other instruments... The ancient Observatory did the observations of  the solar system on what looks to be rudimentary methods but the results were having amazing accuracy. The observatory shows the skills of the Indian scientist and their understanding of the world systems. Jaipur went to hundreds of years ago to predict the movement of the planets and sun.  Despite advances in science and our own knowledge base, the technology of that time remains relevant today, despite our more 'modern' way of determining the position of the planets. If ancient techniques of telling time interest you, this place is fascinating! It is amazing how the scientists of that time period came up with a method of following the sun & moon as they progressed through the sky. Highly recommended! Superbly advance scientific construction with so many things. The place amaze you as well leave you many thoughts are we really superior from our that era? To really enjoy and understand Jantar Mantar, you need to either download a free e-guide, hire a tour guide or get an audio guide from the site.

There are plenty of local guides here to walk you around all the various sundials and celestial tools. They will give you your horoscope, especially if you can tell them time as well as date of birth,,,,, lots... This was a real gem.

The level of detail and work they put into it was amazing. Horoscope in our Sydney papers really need to lift their game :) Impressed by their invented these equipments to measure astronomic in the past. Very knowledge and educate for children to understand the routes of times. Highly recommended!!! This place is an observatory with lots of history and education on astronomy.  The sun dials are so accurate it's incredible to observe and it's interesting to see how much talent and wisdom there was in generating the information that we have freely available on... This garden of astronomical devices was truly amazing, I kept expecting Alice in Wonderland to pop up! Sun clocks, astronomic issues, very interesting stories about this observatory. If you visit City Palace, don't miss it Beautiful well kept park with mind blowing science! Don't bother with a guide or audio tour as all the information is on plaques in front of each installment Interesting to see again with a good guide although looking a little tired nine years after an earlier visit Constructed by Jai Singh, one of five such observatories and probably the best preserved. It contains high resolution sundials (2 or 20 seconds) and various instruments associated with the signs of the zodiac and horoscopes. great construction with amazing design, embedded with scientific principles from the old time. Located in town center of Jaipur. This place is really interesting. It's a bit of history I wasn't expected to find which pleasantly surprised me. It's an observatory definitely different from what I'm used to. There are plenty of instruments, some of which have incredible accuracy. Definitely a very interesting place... Great bit of history to check out in Jaipur! Unfortunately was very hot so couldn’t stay out to watch the water show but will have to if I come back Wonderful place. Accurate knowledge of time up to the accuracy of  2 seconds is astonishing. Must watch to experience our ancient knowledge. This astrological observatory is the heart of Jaipur. 300 year old sun dials are used even today by astrologers to create the forecast for the city. I would definitely recommend hiring a guide to give explanations regarding the instruments and importance of astrology in Jaipur. To see, experience and learn how you could study astronomy in the 18th century using a series of geometrical buildings and constructions is absolutely dazzling. So much effort, imagination and ingenuity. If you are remotely curious about human being capability to surprise, don’t miss this... This place really deserves its UNESCO status. 
I recommend coming here with someone who can explain the instruments to you as the signage is quite basic, or else you would have to do your homework on the net first.  Although at the site it suggests... Jantar Mantar has many Stone & Brass instruments that help to see the Solar Time, to locate stars / planets. The only thing I didn't like is that the price for the audioguide is the same to get into the place, so it doesn't worth it. Anyways, it's a really interesting place to go! A fascinating area, well worth the entry price just to go in and look around. There could be more signage (there's some, but pretty confusing if you're not across astronomy!), but the best bit is just to walk around and look at all the amazing... Last time here back in 1986 on a grand tour of India.  Glad to report it has not changed as is as lovely as I remembered it to be.  Well worth a visit with a good guide. Allow yourself to be guided through this site as the buildings that allowed for the measurements and astronomical predictions which were astounding.  A guide will add significantly to the experience. It's a kind of science museum. I mean there are scientific structures to measure the time, position of planets using sun's position. We made a mistake of not taking a guide service. It is recommended to take a guide so that he will explain about... Its is also an tourist attractions place of rajasthan. Here you can visit with your family. Good budget place for family picnic. Here you know the old rajasthan craft and designing. This site is comprised of multiple buildings of various architectural design that were built in order to conduct astronomical measurements. The buildings in and of themselves are fascinating. However, understanding the manner in which the structures allowed for astronomical measurements and predictions is nothing short... The fact that people could make instruments that are so accurate 300 years ago is truly amazing. But visually it is slightly underwhelming, I think maybe our guide went into far too much detail and the fact we had slightly poorly stomachs but I would... This is an observatory, which was build by Jai Singh II Maharadza in the first half of 18th century. It demonstrates well the Indian interest in astrology and empirical instruments for time measuring at that time. Really interesting place. Their great passion for astronomy translated to a massive scale.  Don't lose the museum video explanation about how the structures work. If you like astronomical observation instruments of large scale and really old, this site is for you. It’s really hot in April so bring a scarf, hat & sunglass. The concrete glare is a killer. Spent 45 min here and it was enough unless you... The Jantar Mantar astronomical observatory contains a collection of astonishing astronomical instruments, some of them enormous, and all fascinating for anyone with an interest in science.  It's best seen when the sun is bright so that the gnomon shadows are clear, but watch yourself --... Guide was informative. Short tour, worth seeing! Hard to get pictures to show scale.ake sure the sun is out. This place is very knowledgeable. There's is a lot to see in this building.  Must visit Place for history lover. When in Jaipur, this is a must visit, so much to look at.  It really is not just a clock !  There are piecs of work representing the earth, showing the meridian lines and much more.
Sculptures representing the astrological star signs.
The time is... By chance we decided to visit janter manter , good architecture ,huge premises and many  old equipment to see. Many zodiac signs. Best place to see the indian astronomy If you aren't interested in astrology, then don't visit!
It was like a huge park full of old gadget to tell the time, date, and zodiac sign stuff!

It was interesting to know and hear the history behind each. 
Cool clicks as well 

Guide's fee... I recommend this place for everyone who has interest of science. It  is a wonderful place with lot of interesting points of view Amazing place how astrology and numbers can make up our being. Wonderful and entertaining place. The Guide was very informative. Catchy title.. i guess.. but yeah Jantar Mantar is basically a clock that was used in earlier times to tell the time and keep track of important lunar and solar events using the suns shadow and a lot of other adjustments. A must visit if... Beautiful  knowledgeable place. Beautifully made full of geometrical images.Very interesting place must visit. I visited this site with a tour guide and was glad to have his input- the site is full of amazing astronomical/astrological works (all outdoors) but with little explanation.  There was a reason for example, that the sun dial showed that it was 1:30 when... We went to Jantar Mantar during our visit to Jaipur. I still remember my history book during my school days having a photo of an instrument in Jantar Mantar - to have a feel of it, I wanted to go there. Since, we did not... It is the oldest time place who tell about time. It is very amazing .it tell the time with the sunrays . i am enjoyed a lot. A scientific astronomical attraction built with precision and geometric accuracy. A must watch. Especially for the young. This place is a must visit. Situated near tripolia bazaar and close to city palace. Short visit of an hour or so. Parking available. You could take a composite ticket which holds good for two days and also gives you entry to designated sites without... Amazing to see the astronomical instruments during older times with much accuracy, Since i didnt understand how most of instruments works, bored after sometime. We visited Jantar Mantar at Jaipur, Rajasthan on 24th February 2018 with my teenage sons. They liked it very much. So this is a series of stone solar instruments for measuring time and more.each piece has a clear description of what it is and what it does and for a three hundred year old monument its accuracy is stunnig. Can be a little busy but... Probably the most original visit you can do in Jaipur. This observatory is really astonishing and the instruments are spectacular. You can calculate time here in many ways and for different seasons ... every natural and authentic way to calculate almost accurate time majorly with... Probably the most original visit you can do in Jaipur. This observatory is really astonishing and the instruments are  spectacular. Even visitors less interested in science should find reasons to appreciate them. The assistance of a competent guide is however  greatly enhancing the experience. This is one of five observatories built by Rajput King Singh II in the early 1700s and which is the best preserved.  There are 16 astronomical instruments, some of which still are functional for telling time and the seasons.  There is one instrument consisting of... Like the one in Delhi but this one is more functional.  Definitely have a guide assist in understanding the many instruments.  Do plan to spend some extra time there as it gets crowded and you have to wait to see many of the devices.  This... Nicely maintained..
Shows brilliant designing and carvings on stones...
Good place for person interested in history and royal architect. Interesting ... however difficult to understand everything. Some more explanations on how the different elements work would be helpful I fell in love with Jaipur city. Its bazaars, monuments, jewels, people, everything is beautiful and friendly. Jantar Mantar is a great astronomic observatory that mix Science, Architecture, Astrology, and Art. The layout of the Observatory is like a Cubist city; the instruments and particular... Sister to, but more impre4ssive than, the one in Delhi, this is absolutely amazing. We visited with Tours by Locals guide, Jaimini Shastri, who brought the whole thing to life. His knowledge of the workings of the instrument was encyclopaedic. I can appreciate these constructions are amazing but I found the whole site a little dull . The sundial was not accurate and in Europe pocket watches were used. It was very very hot also little shade. Very very popular and so many friends told me about this, great tourist attraction in Jaipur, we all loved it. I recommend this with a tour guide as without proper explanations you may just be looking at stone instruments.

With a tour guide this was brilliant and if you like astro physiscs or even astrologoy then this place will go a long way for you... Great travel rep' who explained in detail these brilliant structures how to use the sun to tell the time within seconds, plus much more quite mind boggling, invented & constructed so many years .ago. Had a hour here wandering around. It was very hot while there. So before their time in building this structure, was amazing to see. Astronomy is significant to Indian life and the observatory, which was built some 300 years ago, plots the alignment of the sun and planets. There is one sundial, which gives Jaipur time to an accuracy of 20 seconds, whereas the dominant structure is a ‘sun-dial’... Open air tools that seems years ahead of when the tools were created.  Tools to tell one's astrological sign along with what sign was rising when you were born.  One of the sun dials is accurate to within a few seconds. Great if you are into astronomy, but do hire a guide to make the most of your visit.  Looks of tours groups so at times it was difficult  to hear our guide. Wasn't sure I'd be really bothered with this site, but my wonderful guide Mr Singh made it so interesting and brought it all to life.  Time was spot on as well.    Brilliant place to visit! This place is a gem! Unique! It gives us an opportunity to better understand how advanced India was and how important the Universe is for hinduism. There are structures defining the relationship of the earth to the sun and stars that are beautiful, even if they are difficult to understand. It's the best of them and somehow haunting.  It helps if you can have someone really explain how each structure works - probably not worth going if you haven't read up on it or don't have a guide. My children enjoyed the old structure and its astronomical features which ancient people used. The place is well managed. If you are in jaipur then jantar mantar is a must. The ancient time clock,sun dial,moon dial,all the astrological things going on is still clear even after 400 years. The accuracy is such good that you are mesmerized. Get the combo ticket for all the heritage sites in Jaipur at Jantar Mantar to save a lot of money.
We made the mistake of visiting the Jantar Mantar last and we could not benefit from this offer.
Also keeping a whole day aside for... We visited the Jantar Mantar with family. Jantar Mantar is worth visiting. This is located in the ancient Pink city. The calculations and the accuracy used in the time when technology as limited is amazing. King Jaisingh had initiated efforts to construct this Structure. In simple terms, this structure helps finding time, movement of stars, constellations etc based on the Sun's movement. Though Indians had been known to master the techniques so many thousand years back about Astronomy, Stars etc,... One has to visit Jantar mantar to appreciate the science and intellect of people in historical time to study celestial objects. I went here last weekend. It's a good place, and much larger than Delhi's Jantar Mantar. It's a great place to be if you are interested in science & history. The guides are there to explain about each of the artifacts there. Other than that,... I'm mesmerized with knowledge and skills of king Jai Singh.
Amazingly represent the universe of planet in tiny park. I storngly recommend visit to place... All info is available on Google so not repeating hear. Only one suggestion, plz take guide fr better exposure. Wednesday 14th February and we were in Jaipur exploring the sights and attractions. We purchased a composite ticket for 1,000 Rupees each, which covered the entrance fee to 8 attractions and this was one of the 8.

It was also the first attraction we visited... My wife and I visited the Jantar Mantar astronomical observatory in January as part of a 'Great Rail Journeys' tour of 'The Golden Triangle' and Shimla. To be honest - on paper - it seemed the least interesting site in a very full itinerary. We... A must thing to do as it is an intersting piece of work shows it's acuracy as well as science and art involved in it's construction. Jantar Mantar proves to us the knowledge that our country had much before European times. The astronomical calculations done there is amazing. But to understand all that it is better to take a guide. From the moment I entered this place we were like wow wow nd wow ... were little confused to understand different signs there but when the guide explain everything to us then we came to know the real beauty of this historic place ... Simply... Jantar Mantar is a very interesting collection of astronomical instruments just across the road from the city palace in Jaipur.  The main attraction is the world's largest stone sundial, however the other instruments are equally impressive.  At first we wandered around trying to make sense... Built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II, and completed in 1734. This place has the biggest sundial in the world. It's recommended taking a guide along as one would not be able to see all the instruments and understand them just by looking... If you have a keen sense of astronomy, then you must visit this place. It feels proud to witness the level of scientific development that our ancestors had reached. The upkeep of this place has been good. Must visit. I recommend to take a guide to understand these fantastic astronomical architectures. Nice collection of Zodiacs placed thoughtfully. It is very interesting to see the amount of interest shown by our ancestors to measure time and seasons that too such an accuracy.
Must... This site contains the world's largest sun dial, calibrated in 2 second intervals. There are also many other astronomical structures to determine the position of stars and the sun. Fascinating to anyone with a scientific bent. Situated in the heart of city near city palace and hawa Mahal. Little crowded, Parking space is available.Guide is must to know about astrological structures. Kids felt proud to know about ancient Indian scientific and astrological structures. I recommend you to go in the morning while most of the tourists are visiting Amber fort so you can hire a guide and have the place for yourself. It’s a very interesting place, you’ll learn about Indian astrology, the importance and the power of... This is a masterpiece of invention. Here is the world’s largest sun dial which is accurate to two seconds. A collection of masonry instruments; very interesting with English descriptions but it would be good to read up a bit on astrology before visiting This was an unexpected place, more unusual than any other tourist place I have seen in India or many other countries. Huge sundial and beautiful sculpture like astrological devices with architectural merit. The place tells u about the science related with time planets and the structures were so amazing. And one biggest thing without any technological advance of that time maharaja jaisingh did a wondersul job.... they could actually predict even the weather change... i think people... We didn’t really know what we were entering as it appeared like some sort of fun park but it’s actually a science lab for astrology and it was absolutely fascinating. I recommend you have a guide though for this and we found ours very knowledgable... This is one of two places in Jaipur where you really need an actual human guide (other option being the audio guide). The place has a bunch of large architectural astronomical  instruments which help in telling time of the day to the second, basis moment... Go in with a guide you won’t lose out on the valuable information regarding the Jantar Mantar.

500- Foreigners It can be interesting for people who understand smth in astronomy but you won`t get much without a guide. Jantar Mantar is worth visiting in Jaipur, the calculations and the accuracy used in the time when technology as limited is amazing. If you are interested in astronomy this it the place to be. It houses several astrological structures that were built in the 17th - 18th century .It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.It is located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal of Jaipur, Great place to contemplate how someone so long ago thought up how on earth to tell the time! Some measures were not working and in need of restoration but you need a decent guide that understands how it works and has good enough English it... We decided to check out Jantar Mantar on the suggestion of a guide. He didn’t explain much other than it’s a place to measure things. 

Essentially it’s a collection of sundials. 

My kids liked learning about their personal zodiac symbol and how it applies to... If you are into astrology this is the place for you. It houses several astrological structures that were built in the 17th - 18th century although they look like someone made them from concrete.Without a guide, it is a bit baffling as to there function.... Hello friends, I visited Jaipur with my family about a month ago and really love that city.It is there best tourist place to go in holidays.There we visited many places and Jantar Mantar is one of them. I can't describe there beauty of the infrastructure... Visited as part of our golden triangle tour with tui. Were given a very knowledgeable guide there who was very good at explaining the sight. It was fascinating. A must visit in Jaipur. This place houses fascinating astrological structures that were built in the 17-18th century. With both historical and contemporary relevance.
Definitely among best places to see in Jaipur, though, there's little shade within the complex and without a guide, might be baffling. It would initially looks like a boring visit with just a collection of massive and strange sculptures. But, once you observed and understood each instrument you would be in awe. Worth a visit. Nice place.. Gathered..full of tourist.. can consider dis a scientific place.. Too hot to visit during hot weather.. Even in December it was too hot to visit during afternoon hours.. But must visit place to witness the scientific facts at early age when there was... This is a not to be missed,if you remember Von Danikens notably inaccurate books
It is fascinating and impressive 
Do not miss the opportunity if you pass by Very interesting tour with our guide....the accuracy of the clocks are amazing! Also loved the astrological signs and sculptures. A great place to visit in Jaipur! This place looks like a children's playground with slides and things to climb on.  But then you take a close look and everything has calibration marks.  This was a state of the art observatory in the 18th century capable of measuring the movement of the... This place was great if you are into astronomy. I'm not so was average as I didn't really care what degree the sun was at. Can take some nice pictures and worth a quick look if you are nearby. We visited with friend and children and all of us was happy to see this amazing place. The way it’s built and maintained till now is amazing. you find all 12 zodiac signs over there in big shape. you see also sun-dial and various other astro instruments over there in big size. I found this place overjoyed, maybe because it was too crowded plus the searing heat made it difficult to navigate 

One could use a guide to get a better idea Without a guide this is may seem confusing however if you book a guide or an audio tour (either about 200 rupees) then you get some great information on how the items worked and it's a really fascinating trip. Also they have the world's largest... Only requires a short visit, but it is interesting, both from a historic point of view, and also when you consider how much significant astronomy still has on todays society in India. We had a wonderful guide in Kumar who took us all around this incredible place and explained all the structures. You definitely need a guide as otherwise it would look like a modern day sculpture park.
This is an amazing place whose structures are still... At first this just seems like a collection of random structures but by studying each one carefully you will see how the time was was known by using sundials of various design.
I was amazed that the facility was initially created starting in 1724. After ur visit to City Palace, Jantar Mantar is just a five minute walk away. It closes at 5pm. I would recommend take a guided tour to understand what d instruments on display do exactly. On ur own, u wouldn't understand anything bcoz there are... I was not familiar with Jantar Mantar until our holiday in India organised by Incredible Tour To India 

Well worth a visit and spending some time walking around the various “ instruments “ - good to have a guide , as we did , to... If you're visiting the city Palace, you'll find your way here. It's pretty unbelievable how clever some of the sun dials are and they still work. This has a ""modern"" sculpture vibe. Don't miss it. This place is basically the planetarium of olden era and reminds the talent of olden people. Don't think that here you will have any video show of planets rather you will be able to see the instruments built that time to study planets. You need... Mark, my friends. This place is only for scientifically inclined and not for average joe. Its what Sawai Man singh built out of his own interest and even invented himself couple of instruments. Its a pretty small place and you can finish it in flat... Having a guided tour is essential to get the full benefit of visiting this site.  The site looks like a museum of stunningly beautiful pieces of sculpture, but, is in fact an astronomical World heritage site.  All pieces are in working order and are extremely...

A local guide is nice, but not entirely necessary as each of the fixtures has a plaque that describes... Great if you have interest in palmistry and how science worked in that era.
Worth a look. Do take a guide with you Well worth a visit. Get a guide otherwise you will struggle to understand. We spent a few hours here without a guide , but it would have been better if we understood all of it. Mind-bending astronomical/astrological installation but just ad important an oasis in the centre of the chaotic Pink City! Located near City Palace, this astronomical monument, the largest Stone Sundial definitely needs a proper guide to be understood.  However, even if it is not understood in terms of astronomy, be rest assured, it is still a treat to watch.  This UNESCO World Heritage site... What a fascinating place. Anyone with half and interest in the stars will marvel at this place! Absolutely loved it! Without Guide one can't possibly understand anything .. Don't try to eavesdrop, one can't possibly eavesdrop to everything ... so get a guide they will explain everything .. Audioguide isn't worth at all at this place . It’s a eye opener to the marvel of technology from the past. You must take a guide to understand the mechanism and working of the various mechanics. 

With mentioning is Dr. Sharma (our guide, # 9950095046). 

Not only a wonderful guide, he is a good... This is worth the visit, especially with a good guide to explain the workings and history.  It’s also fun to watch the chipmunks. Situated next to City Palace, it is a must go place for one who is interested to see how Astronomical movements were studied in the past.
It gives a proud feeling to know how advanced Indians were in precised astronomical calculations when there were no... I was here after visiting the area alone and walking around in Jaipur... The area is nice, and there are some descriptions of different instruments, but I think that in order to fully appreciate it would have been necessary to have an expert guide.
Otherwise... Be sure to get a knowledgeable guide.  This incredible place is a must see.  I have been there 5 or 6 times and still find it fascinating.  Great photo ops. Jantar Mantar is mush visit this is beautiful palace every ware looking more tourist. Click the photography every angle. Maybe with a guide this would’ve been better, we didn’t get one, only went because it was part of our composite tickets and didn’t really know what we were looking at. It’s beautiful but I feel like I missed the point. The Amber Palace is a wonderful place to visit. There are lots of nooks and crannies to explore, and you can easily get away from crowds by ducking up a steep staircase or into a side corridor. 

Caution - the mahouts are quite pushy, should... Impressive collection of astronomical and time measurement instruments. Need at 90 mins to properly understand their functions. Getting a good guide is very helpful. Jantar Mantar is the best example to understand how in ancient times, when ther was no technology ,people synced themselves with nature and invention happened.Unbelievable and precise Sun clocks, Astronomy instruments and Astrology structures. visit if you got time. Nice to see how brilliant our ancestors were. Great place to visit with kids and family This place in jaipur has very accient and heritage look. In this place we can see how in olden days when no clock or calendar were available.  People use to check their birth date; time,  fix their horsescope.  
We can see in this place how... Our guide called this the observatory.
It was built by the King who had an interest in astronomy. He used the best specialists in the world to design and build. 
Each piece relied on the sun and being built to 27% angle - one showing... This is must visit place you need guide to understand all clocks and  signs. Very nicely setup. Historic and need to spend time here during trip. There are 5 Jantar mantar in India but this is the only one in working condition.It is amazing to see how these people who were geniuses,made these instruments,which show you time accurately,zodiac signs,the planetry influences,so accurately,almost 300yrs ago. You'll be amazed to see how advanced the astrological science in old days. There are lots of big instruments in Jantar Mantar, which were used to calculate time, position of planets and stars and many more. Take a guided tour to understand how these instruments... You will be amazed by the mind that was kept to build the astronomical instruments. Great and meaningful architectures. Amazed by the skill of the master who built this place. Very interesting , it is helpful going there with a guide full of astronomical instruments having awesome collection you will love to see them so enjoy with friends and capture good images I would not say that Jantar mantar is a must but, if you're in the city centre, you may as well include it in your tour. It's very close to other attractions, is not time consuming or expensive to visit and makes for an intriguing... Visit the observatory only if you’re interested in horoscopes and astrology otherwise it’s hard to understand what’s going on. Very nice if you are interested in astrology, and stars. amazing to see how all this was done 300 years ago Well worth the time and entrance fee. A side of India I never knew existed. A guide to explain it all is neccessary. Essential for those into astronomy. I loved the place. Hardly can believe in ancient times indians were so much scintifically advanced. This place is a real evidence of indian scientific achievements in old times. This trip start on 21st 
Frist visit to Udayapur . See tha place

..... Interesting to see how, so many years ago, people managed to invent and erect sun clocks, astronomy instruments and astrology structures. Its very good place to go horror too jantar mantar the bhul bhaliya we go there wid frnds enjoy alot there take pics its historical centre so very good environment The area is so congested that crossing the road is a nightmare. The traffic police are unhelpful and rude. There is only one food stall where every body is trying to buy some food by shouting over the others shoulder. The stall owner are absolutely... If you like astronomy, truly worth a visit, a large  historic complex, very well preserved of astronomical biuldings, get there early when not to crowded, but definitely worth a visit. Suggest you take the audio guide as it could be little confusing to find out the strange architecture This activity required guide help with out which there is no use of  seeing each monument. Hence  engage good guide so that you can understand things easily. It’s nice to see the ‘modern’ forms built 400 years ago.
It isn’t a too long visit.. 
don’t forget to buy a combine ticket for all Jaipur attractions. We strolled around here recently without a guide not really understanding what we were viewing. 

The astronomical instruments are very impressive to view but to understand how they work properly a guide should be hired I was reluctant to go here because it didn’t look great on the pictures I’d seen, but it ended up being one of the highlights of Jaipur. It was built 300 years ago to tell date, time, stars, horoscope etc with an amazing accuracy. Fun... It’s amazing how this observatory is hundreds of years old! The guides explained everything in English so that we could appreciate just how phenomenal this feat was. Accurate within 2 seconds! I overlooked this in my last trip and I’m glad I went this time. Ancient technology but very amusing to see things developed so long ago when no Google exists. Exciting if you like history It's hard to put Jantar Mantar into words really, what on the face of it look like some quite simple constructions are really quite mind blowing when you consider they are sun dials which tell the time. I think if I were to visit again... An amazing place to visit. So interesting, we took some lovely photos here. A variety of sundials and calendars beautifully laid out and not that busy or expensive when we went. This was the best scientific place I have seen. I have learnt a lot from this place. There was a room which had a TV in which they showed us about the Jantar mantar. There was a sundial which showed the exact time of the... Definitely get a guide this is a really great place to visit.  Was interesting to see and even if you are not into the stars it is architecturally beautiful 

Fairly uncrowded so felt peaceful to saunter round away from the crowds There is an entrance fee-you can buy them individually or go for the composite fee.rs 500/pp for Indian nationals.Includes the Jantar mantar,hawa mahal,amber fort, navgarh fort&one another.You need a guide to understand what it’s all about. A guide is must if you visit this place. We had taken an audio guide which was very helpful as it explains all technical details. The sight has a collection of large, stone astronomical instruments.  It was really amazing to walk around and see the different instruments, all of which still works.  If you have an interest in astronomy or astrology, this is a really cool place to visit. Totally amazing display of sundials and astrological instruments from 1700s.  All are totally accurate and very impressive. We spent about 2 hours wandering around here evesdropping on the English speaking guides. They all seemed very knowledgeable and able to explain and demonstrate the various pieces of equipment. I would recommend getting a guide as the info boards, while comprehensive, don't actually demonstrate... The visit to Jantar Mantar was simply amazing. The sun dials which can depict time with an accuracy of a few seconds are among the best exhibits ... to think that these were created a few hundred years ago! An absolute must-see. I have been there since it was  included in our package.  Frankly speaking i could not understand the whole purpose.  But for sure the place has a big scientifi  value.  Same was built by  king to check the time and weather.  If you are science... To see what scientists could do back in the olden days without the use of electronics and set up and work  these instruments was truely amazing. You must visit this place in Jaipur. You must take a guide for proper  understanding this place. Good scientific place to visit. Amazing collection of what look like abstract sculptures, but which are, in fact, astronomical machines erected in the 18th century, including a sundial which gives the time in Jaipur accurate to 2 seconds. Amazing place to visit in Jaipur, really interesting how all this was built, unfortunately, we visited this site after as part of a tour, but after lots of flights/travelling, so we probably did not give it the full attention it deserved. Astronomy is the correct term, but be prepared to have your mind blown and your creative side awakened. Basically, Jantar Mantar is a sundial which tells time (considering the correction factor mentioned). It is one of the brilliant inventions made in India. If you don't have any guide and you're quite clueless about the facts, just take an audio tour (cost 200 Rs). Visiting Jantar Mantar without a good guide would be a waste of time. Factor for at least 45-60 mins to get a good overview. There are so many instruments here built in old times to tell what time is it, or which constellation a child is born in, or what's the direction of Sun, etc. Take the guide with you, who will demonstrate at all these instruments that how... Before some time we visited Delhi Jantar mantar. This jantar mantar is our second visit, but this was with a guide. It was amazing! It makes a lots of difference with guide. Time, height of sun, Rashi etc can be calculated. Proud of the knowledge... It is the place where u can find how ancient people know time,make kundli, nakshtra, hindi calendar etc. For proper understanding of all the equipments u must have to take a guide.Charges are 300/group for guide. I visited this place as part of my day tour in Jaipur. I learned a number of new things during my visit and it was a great experience. A word of caution: it's mostly outdoors so bring an umbrella if it's a hot sunny day. I thought this part of the Trip would be boring and uninteresting.
But actually it's not at all It's quite surprising actually the maths and geometry that must have gone into building this project The guide is extra but unless you really know your stuff about astrology and mathematics, it would be a struggle without one. A nice retreat from the horns, sellers and beggars - take a picknick must visit when i jaipur . a very well maintained plsce , very clean , staf was good too . 

best to take a guide so they they can explain the place well One of the must see tourist spots in Jaipur, January mantra is close to the city palace and the Hawa mahal, so the 3 can be done in a day. It's great going on a wintery sunny day, there is much to see and enough... I visited this place in February 2017. 
Its really a great place which explains how clever our ancestors are !!
You will find huge amount of astrological information in a simple manner.
It also reflects knowledge of people about Sun, Moon, Astrology.
The place is... It is a very good place to visit. It is a historical place with a lot of old scientific buildings used to calculate the time and tell what date it is. It was also used for finding distances of astronomical objects in space. It also... include in your sightseeing program jantarr mantal, you need a guide to explain all these constructions, that they proof the ancient knowledge of this magnificent people! the guide will explain that they show the exact time in seconds!! the position of earth in the solar... The technology used and deployed by the Maharaja in this observatory is wonderful to see.

Incredible to find out how they were able to map out the stars and sun so accurately All those years ago but they knew enough about the heavens to build these amazing constructions. The two biggest astronomical clocks are  a wonder. A pleasant hour or  so just wandering about. An absolutely fascinating astrological site for people of all ages and interests.

Not normally a problem in Jaipur but sadly for our visit, it was very cloudy and we couldn't read the various instruments. It was still amazing to... Not sure what they're charging for. It costs 200rs per person if you are an international tourist. The observatory was interesting and a nice place to wander around but definitely not value for money. Should be free, if not max price 50rs. Left feeling disappointed. Had a whistle stop tour round here as we had to get going but it is very impressive with interesting sundials including one over 40ft tall! There are guided tours which I suspect would have been good. It's only 100rupees for students :) Considering when this stuff was built it's crazy how they can be so accurate.
Price isn't too bad for entry at R200 but get either a audio guide or a real guide or the structures will mean nothing to you. This is an interesting place to visit, but the visit should ne short, you definitely need a guide to explain all the instruments on site. An incredible place to visit.

All things Planetary, Astronomy or Astronomical, Celestial, Astronomy, Out-of-this-World, or whatever, leave me stone cold. Load of Hocus-Pocus.

So why go ? I wanted to visit the City Palace round the corner... Jantar Mantar is now the largest and best preserved of India's heritage astronomical facilities. Jaipur completed the Jantar Mantar to travel the skiesin 1735. Jantar Mantar is a proof of the spectacular extent of human achievement.

The guide was great and really bought the place alive. The accuracy of the sundials is amazing. This observatory is unlike anything I have seen and is fascinating. The way the variety of installations use the Sun to make a range of time and other measurements is wonderful and well worth a visit. A place that makes you feel insignificant, due to the magnitude of the instruments and the depth and precision of the discoveries. The Maharaja's passion and what he made out of it are absolutely fascinating. It is worth a slow visit with an excellent guide. A well maintained attraction at Jaipur. Great for students and tourists both. Instruments still work accurately.

I found it fascinating however sundials and astrological clocks may not be... What a very clever man. Its a pity that it was such a hot day we were there as we had to cut our visit short to get out of the sun An interesting and varied view of the astronomical works of Jai Singh.

The people who made this place had such attention to details.  Able to predict the time down to the nearest 2 seconds.  Not only are these instruments smart (before we even had smart devices) but they are a thing of beauty. In Jaipur,it is must watch place. Guide is required to understand the clock science.it takes 45 mins to visit the place completely Astonishing technology used in 17th century. Great place for history enthusiasts. Keen observation is necessary Good for killing an hour or so, not much more.  Read the explanations at each of the 18? instruments to see how the sun was used to tell time, latitude and lognitude, inclination of the sun, planets, zodiac features, and more. Located opposite the city palace, this is a wonder. The precision of astronomy is amazing & best describes the brain of ancestors. In absence of present precision & modern equipment, the level of precision of these structures is amazing. A fascinating collection of me reading pieces all dependent on celestial light energy and geometry. Not really my cup of tea from that point of view but I did get  couple of great photographs!! The place reaffirms that India has always been at the forefront of science since ages. The different instruments spread across the premises give a glimpse into scientific acumen. The sun dial is a pretty interesting instrument. Very well maintained place. The place was used to calculate exact time by the measurement of son's position over quadrants at different latitudes . Quite interesting to observe . Amazing place. Surprising to see how even in ancient times, people were able to device such amazing instruments, with precision. A must see place for science enthusiasts and overall for everyone. There are atleast 100 people ahed of you on the ticket counter making you wait for about 45 mins before you reach the queue. When you enter you will find a sundial and about 10 closed doors. There is nothing else Very interesting especially if you are interested in horoscopes and astrology. It shows how they would keep track of what house the sun was in the 1700s? (Don't quote me on that, to lazy to research). Also contains the world's largest sundial. More interesting than I expected...science and astrology in one.
Go early to avoid crowds and heat.
You definitely need a guide to explain the features. Don't take a guide the place is simple to walk around.

Also make it quick, not much to see. 

Take more time at Jantar Mantar rather than Hawa Mahal Next to city place, cover this place in morning if you are with children , since it tends to get hot in afternoon. Take a guided tour to get more information about different structures. This monument is a must visit if you are touring Rajasthan. This place is a specialization for astronomical architecture. It holds world's largest Sundial made of stone. Nearly 20 different type of instruments built in this observatory in 18th century itself - very precise. Impressed. Hundreds of years old and still pertinent today. Who needs technology when you can use your own brain like this. Human race is getting dumber instead of smarter.

Jantar Mantar is a must watch place in Jaipur to know about how advanced our Science was even in the past. The visit would be pointless if you don't hire a guide because you won't understand the purpose behind the structures built. Its place to visit in cloudy days or in evening. No shed to take rest expect few places. 

Its a place to appreciate contribution to science in astrology to understand our world with justified techniques. I can see how Indian are proud of this and in fact this is amazing as there was no telescope when this was built.  Personally I am not big fan of this part of science so not too much interesting..... We visited with our city guide and definitely enjoyed it. It's amazing to learn about the technology that was being used so long ago to analyze astronomy. I would say astronomy/science lovers would love this place in particular but it's interesting in general. Amazing place in easy to find central location. We totally enjoyed the science behind it all. Take a hat...and plenty of water - it's a concrete jungle that can get hot hot hot. Very surprised with this place, after being disappointed in the one in Delhi we almost didn't bother to enter, however, it was excellently painted, clean and thoroughly explained. Delhi's Jantar mantar should take note! I was able to visit this site twice.  Being as it was built almost 300 years ago it is amazing how accurate these instruments are.  I especially recommend this site to anyone interested in astronomy, astrology, and science in general. Very nice place.  Good place to see ancient science equipment made in India to check time and planet activities Visited on a beautiful sunny afternoon, with no idea of what we were to see and experience! Fortunately we came with  a guide who did an excellent job of explaining and answering our questions about the astrological instruments/sundials. It is an amazing place. On the ay we visited it hit 40C so we didn't give it full justice as after about 30 minutes we bolted for the very pleasant shaded garden and bar 
That being said the tour itself of the various instruments and gadgets was fantastic and... Lovely place to visit to know about the method, used by old peoplet to know about time, astrology and plants.  Beautifully &Well maintained property. Buy a composite ticket for whatever places. Do hire a guide. This is difficult to know otherwise what the structures are for. Still can't believe I paid 200 for the entrance. Modern art nonsense with nothing much to see. 
It's like a park with weird new - age structures. 
Overall, the city is quite dirty so I suppose some come here to be in a clean environment.... Never seen anything like this place before, interesting even if we didn't understand all the ""instruments"" Don't take a tour guide, as all the exhibits have quite detailed notices attached and on ""overhearing"" what some of the Guides were saying, they didn't really seem to... A must see, astronomical structures at there best, pick a fine sunny day and you will see there purpose in all their glory, as I said at the beginning , a must see. About a 15-20 min tuc tuc ride but well worth a visit. The monkeys are very tame. Be aware u have to pay rs50 to use your camera. Overall a nice place Interesting place to visit. You will know how the ancient Indian people decided the time and horoscopes in that era. Though wise to hire a guide to learn the wisdom and purpose of the many sculptural pieces, we simply enjoyed the visual characteristics and designs, and felt the scientific meanings might be a strain on our already boggled minds. pictures really don't do this place justice, you need to see it in person to experience the overwhelming scale of these instruments. we read ahead of time that the instruments are better understood with a guide, but we did pretty well without one- the placards... This jantar Mantar is world's best observatory.it was built by King Sawai Jai Singh.This is very famous in world tourism. Went to visit on a hot sunny day at around 12:30.  Guide is must if you want to know properly about all the instrument. It's so amazing how all scientific stuff were functional during those days.try clicking pics with ur specific zodiac sign structures. It's... Very insteresting place to visit. You will get to see the world largest sun clock. It will amaze you what indian people could do backbon the days and to what precision on top of that. This is one place that really makes you in awe of how advanced in knowledge Indians were. Its amazing to see how the exact latitudes and longitudes and even the time is calculated all based on the shadows of the sun or positioning of the... I'm so glad a friend recommended.  It really is quite amazing  - make sure somebody is there to tell you about or read up on it before you go, so you can see how each ""clock"" works. Very interesting place. So many ways to tell the time with the sun and astrology. Never seen anything like it. Royal palace short walk away Very interesting place to visit, old past technology makes me wonder who would have thought to make all this very very interesting place to visit regarding how time was calculated few centuries back and was so accurate how they use to calculate months and year... Good to see from education point of view. Give time , read the old Technics of measurements. You will find interesting, if you have not seen any other Jantar Mantar. Hello

One of the best places I went to in Jaipur! It was quite hot when we visited in January there was no shade .It was very interesting but very technical. If astronomy is your thing you will enjoy it Why go here? The are maybe 6 different exhibits, the loads of replicas of what you have just seen. They all evolve around time, I just didn't find it off any interest Compared to the one in Delhi, this Jantar Mantar is well maintained, adequate descriptions of each installation given and well spaced out.  Audio tours are also available Janter Manter is not just a simple observatory it is vision of Maharaja Swai Jai Singh who wanted to see how he can check his knowledge on scientific grounds. He got this knowledge in heritated to him from his mother. He tried making first small... This was one place on our itinerary which I was thinking of skipping.

We were privileged to be guided in our tour by Nabu Singh, whose exceptional knowledge (MA History), experience and interpersonal relations accumen made the visit a memorable learning experience.

City palace, Museum, wind palace are located near to Jantar mantar. I appreciated the thought that went into creating this as it was obviously brilliant.

A very interesting and enjoyable visit but only takes about 45 minutes. Do not miss this attraction in Jaipur.

I just kept thinking... at that era.. when there were no space trip...... Jantar Mantars - each of them in India are a fabulous site to visit. Especially if you can read up a little about them. Right now, it is a little difficult to visualise how it works, some thing to make that easier especially for children... Jantar Mantar really appeals to the geek in me. I've previously visited Jantar Mantar in New Delhi (which allowed more access to the instrument), but the Jaipur site is more beautiful. I love the sweeping arcs. A photographer's delight.

Some of the monuments were also used to find perfection in Astrology.( Rashis) an unbelievable mixture of Science , Geography and... Replica of Delhi with smaller size.
Near Hawa mahal & City palace.
Avoid viewing light & sound show.its really ordinary & has lot of background score with limited lighting variations. Janter mantar is historical place and it is very beautiful ,I was going jantar mantar with friend and i very enjoying Initially we did not hire guide as we did not realise it's importance. When we entered inside, there were many structures which we did not understand. It's difficult to understand those structures just by reading little information provided there. There was no point in just... I will say that, this was the best part of my Jaipur visit.  No words to describe it. It shows the knowledge of Astronomy our people had. A must visit place for People interested in Science and Astronomy. Especially if you have the combination ticket and are walking around the City Palace area, this is a worthwhile place to spend an hour. The instruments are oddly fascinating, and apparently all work very well. Unique and unlike most monuments on the typical tourist itinerary. Entrance fee was too expensive only to look at large solar builodings. The first one was a bit impressive but then they all started to look the same.

There are three more of these kind of places across India and i suggest to go look... Place is to visit but require guide to made us explain about the observatory. This place was constructed by Sawai Man Singh I n he was very good astrologer If one has any idea of astronomy and the study of time, one is bound to be impressed with the Maharaja Sawai Jaisingh's attempt to capture shadows to correct his time-keeping and astronomical charts. 
If you are not a buff, or a nerd, this will... Jantar Mantar was a different experience. I visited here as part of my Cross-Country Bike Trip. There's lot to read about and you should take your time.

Better to visit during day time as we have some instruments which measure time base d on sunlight. Its in middle of city hence easily accessible It is a nice place where one can learn the ancient way of seeing time. One would require a guide to know it better. This is an interesting place to visit and the instruments are incredibly clever. The time on the huge sundial was spot on! This is an observatory built many centuries BC by King Jai Singh and the creation is simply marvelous.  One wonders how they built such grand and accurate place showing accurate time just by Sun movement and shadow. 

There are lots of people offering guide services... Great place to visit if you like to know how time, placement of the pole star and alignment of planets was observed in the olden days. Jaipur's Jantar Mantar is a must see and I recommend taking an hour or so on site to look at it in depth. There are signposts for most of instruments, explaining their use. I'm not sure a local guide is a must, but then I... We came here after visiting the City Palace and it is worth a visit.  All things astronomical and very busy especially in the afternoons.  
Lots to see, very interesting shapes and tools to read the sun.   There is a gift shop and good views of...

Wow, normally not into this kind of place. But It was amazing to see the sundial and learn how timing was measured. Spent bout 45mins here. Cost 200INR to enter, great lil place to get educated a bit. I found this underwhelming, though this might be because I didn't take a guide. There isn't much in the way of signboards to explain what it is you're seeing. Worth maybe half an hour of your time. This park is odd but quite interesting nonetheless, with plenty of informative plaques explaining the mathematical/scientific significance of each section. Until we got inside this attraction I had no idea how amazing it was - so much to see and do.  We had our own guide plus a guide who works at the astrology attraction who explained everything most helpfully.  We were able to take... Very amazing! This place has a lot of scientific instruments created many years ago! I would suggest taking an audio guide in order to better understand the various instruments.

One of the three places you must see in Jaipur. Considering it is over three hundred years old we can all learn from the considerable achievements of the people many years ago. Sadly not all the exhibits are working but those that are are spectacular... Having been disappointed with the poor state of repair of the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi we were pleased to find this venue to be very well tended. Information boards were plentiful and in English. Had it been cooler we would have spent longer exploring... One time sure visit.unique instrumemts which will blow your mind.fun.take government guide which are cheap and also are good.must see for historic lovers.try to see in early morning since there is not much rush at that time.... The most funny part here was; two girls telling each other: ""who cares about the Sun dial, let's take a selfie"". Quite stunning to find this quality of scientific skill in this place. The skill at procduicng these instrunments in marble and lead is simply amazing. Historically,bust it is in old city where more traffic.
If you like to see Rajasthan, this is good old place to see. This wasn't what we expected, in fact it was better. The amazing constructions are very different to anything we have seen before.

They are all well explained and is fascinating for anyone interested in astronomy (or astrology). Since no shade, so better to wear a cap or carry an umbrela in October. A guide can be taken to explain the scientific facts This was by far our favourite place in Jaipur. The open space and interesting exhibitions made for a great afternoon. Make sure to visit the small gift shop as it has some great pieces. Jaipur's contribution to India's rich cultural and scientific heritage has been immense.   Jai Singh's interest in celestial objects led to the creation of majestic instruments. A must visit. In the 1800's king build this place a block away to study horoscope, from your Astral card, horoscope and a big time watch.
Its very nice and it doesn't take long. A well known astrological observatory that you will love, kind of like a science temple! Astrology still plays a central role in contemporary Indian society. hickory dikory dock-jantar mantar is worth observing for the clock to strike with +/- 5seconds accuracy-those times those era their great intelligence with no modern machinery-worth the visit-i prefer approved guide for the same.

There are a number of smaller sundials as well. It was very busy when we were there but well... We thought that this would be not so good to keep us interested but it did.  We found it amazing just how long ago people were clever enough to invent these items plus the understanding of our world and outer space. Also how the horoscope... Worth a visit and need to get a guide to understand what the place is about. Something a bit different in a work full of palaces. This place is mind blowing. Get a guide to learn how it all works.

Would definitely revisit. Very interesting. Our tour guide brought us here and was able to explain a lot. I am not sure how it would be with out a guide but we were really able to appreciate the scientific study that went on here. You can tell the... This place is like an supersized Greenwich Observatory. I think Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur was a bit into his sundial but not too bothered about making anything portable. Fun place and you can get right up close for the stone instruments, some of... The observatory was very impressive with its numerous sun dials. You need the sun to see, but try to go in the morning when it's not so hot. We almost fried in the afternoon sun. If you are planning to visit Jaipur aka Pink City and wanna get your mind blown, Jantar Mantar should be on the top of your list.

You will find so many forts and palaces in Rajasthan but you won't find another place like Jantar Mantar.... Wonderful prevision in creating these masterpieces of timemachine. Wish there were genuine guides to explain the intricacies of the construction, whey did htey do so, and why it is n ot being used for purposes other than tourism. Excellent place to visit. You will have amazed to see an art of engineering before 300 years. Properly maintained place as always in Rajasthan. You'll need guide to understand the place. Great example of astronomy tools - read the background story behind Shah Jahan and you'll be impressed by amount of time and knowledge invested in building this set of tools. Jantar Mantar is for those people who are curious to know how time calculations were made when there were not mechanized clocks..

it is a wonderful display of ancient science... I visited Jantar Mantar in june at around midday (without a cap) - not very clever of me! This is fully outdoors so I would suggest that you avoid the midday sun when visiting; I saw a number of tourists hiding under any shaded area... I did not take a guide so my review is based on a layman trying to understand and appreciate the place. Apparently it houses multiple ways in which sun's movement helps understand time, solar period etc. 
The place closes at 5pm and last ticket issued... Definitely worth visiting especially if your interested in history or astronomy. I was in awe of the size and scale of this place. We were lucky and had an expert guide take us around the instruments and explain what each did. They are architecturally interesting in their own right, but you would miss a lot without an explanation. Infact jus zapped. A must visit plc in jaipur. It has so much info in itself.. Very useful plc to take kids n lots of learning... I visited Jantar Mantar in October at around midday (without a cap) - not very clever of me!

Spent a couple hours here. This fascinating place was a great learning experience about how they used astronomy to determine time, dates and astrology
However, you must have a knowledgeable guide to explain the function of the objects otherwise it will j uhh st appear as please s saint statues This structure reflects the ancient Indian Vedic Science & Technology .

This observatory dates back to the 18th century. Very cheap! The area was full of instruments for astrology and the positions of the earth etc! If that's not your thing probs wouldn't bother! Worth the chance tho! Would definitely recommend this place & visit again. We paid a guide ( charges are fixed) and he was very informative. We would be a little lost without the guide. It's an absolute must even if you aren't an astronomer lover. This beats the Greenwich... Just to see all those devices used hundreds of years ago to measure time and distance of objects using the sun, it's just incredible
Don't let the sun discourage you from taking a good slow round and trying to understand those intelligent devices This place is brilliant, constructed for someone that was well ahead of his time. Multiple equipment and structures here provide accurate reflections of time, star gazing and other astrological wonders. I was surprised to see engineering was so advanced in India even so many years ago. One can learn mathematics practically here! There is a giant sundial built hundreds of years ago and several others around it.  The guides have a limited knowledge of the various pieces.
There is limited shade, so be prepared for the sun as it gets hot even in Winter. This part of the Royal Palace in Jaipur was truly a unique experience. Astrological creations invented by the King himself! Beautiful place to visit and it makes a change from visiting the forts, palaces, markets.

Extremely accurate timepieces considering how old some are. Very interesting, but go on a sunny day. Really amazing site. It helped that we had a guide explaining the instruments to us. I went to Jantar Mantar in Delhi, but didn't get as much out of it without the explanation/discussion. If you don't have a guide, you may want to stick close... it has interesting facts and gives us an idea of the survival of ppl in olden days.....

Strongly recommend that you have a guide to explain how these various sundial structures worked. Their precision is remarkable. Our tour guide made it more interesting by explaining a lot of what it was about.  However, my friend found it a bit boring, especially as it was very hot at the time.  Would not necessarily go for a third time!! My husband's profession made this a must see for him but even I was enthralled by the precision of this. It came at the end of our guided tour and we were probably rushed through it but well worth seeing. This is a neat place if you're into this stuff. My wife was bored out of her skull. They have a short video,presentation which you can hardly hear because of the volume, cheap speakers and rude tourists. What a beautiful place.. You should at least spend 3-4 hours to understand all the fabulous techniques built here Very interesting and precise astrological/astronomical instruments! Was surprized by the calculations made possible with the 2 semi-spheres! The place is all about Earth & its rotation, Solar system, time, Astrology etc. You can see and experience some interesting equipments, concepts & logics behind Indian  ancient   science.  Not advisable for kids below 5 years. Also AVOID SUNNY DAYS or hot & humid afternoon....

Many of these huge astronomical instruments created to measure the position... This observatory is a really fascinating place to visit. Very interesting and educational. A visit here is a must!

Astronomical instruments are just wow. you need a guide who can tell you science behind these instrument or it will be a waste visit. wear goggle and cap if you are going in day time.

The astronomical equipment is equally fascinating and amazing in its complexity and accuracy.  This is an eyeopener not to be missed.

Our guide explained some of the site to us but in reality we could have done with more to understand it better. It's absolutely fascinating. This place is near city place but has a separate ticket for entrance in jantar mantar. the students here also gets the discounted price on carrying a valid id card. The place is average. Remarkable astronomical andbastrological observatory built in the 18th century.  The giant sundial here a still accurate to 2 seconds.

This place is a fascinating collection of measurement instruments for the declination of the earth, the time, and the constellations as they appear in the sky. The fact the this science was done in the 1600-1700s, when other places were only just exiting the Middle... Compared to jantar mantar in delhi this one was worth a visit . BETTER TO VISIT IN THE evening say 3 pm or so . Because it will b too hot from 8 Am on Initially, some time back we have visited Delhi Jantar Mantar which told as replica of Jaipur. then we naturally kept high expectations but very poor and astonishingly pathetic maintenance. 
On other part one must definitely appreciate King jai Singh for his thoughts on time calculation,... Inside there is nothing to see. From the outside you can have a photo and that's it. Nothing spectatular or unique.    At least it is only 250rupies but should be for free. It is located centrally in the wall city, actual pink area of Jaipur. Very interesting spot for science student , one can see nearby three more main attractions of city namely, City palace, Govind dev ji Temple and Hawa Mahal.Tourist should enjoy Pandit Ki Kulfi... We came here in the middle of the day and explored the Jantar Mantar.

Jaipur Jantar mantar is not that enough good as delhi Jantar Mantar. A poor view and dirty place. not to be visited Nice to explore old astronomy Park. Not much to see, but anyway interesting. Price is 200 rupees, but they offer only few monuments in different sizes. a good place for the persons who has a a dream to visit ancient places the good place to visit with fine things. It's an amazing place. I was surprised to know the scientific knowledge of King Jai Singh. I think he was a great scientist in that day. Even though this is a exceptional piece of art and architecture created in olden days to get the position of solar system, but sine there is no one who can now actually read and demonstrate the results of the same it is not that interesting Maybe itd be better with a guide but we went on a sunny day and the white ground made the place unbearable to even look at. Would recommend sunnies!! Try to visit this before City palace the entry closes sharp at 4:30 P.M. and the exit closes at 5:00 PM. don't go there if there is no sunlight (if its a cloudy day). A tour guide or audio tour guide is must there as... It is a great place if you are into astrology.

The time predictions are pretty accurate and really sweep you off the floor when you realize that this was done way before the sophisticated instruments available today were being used . You must visit Jantar Mantar to witness ancient tools which helps to get accurate astrological movement and other calculation. Jantar Mantar is adjacent to Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar of Jaipur is the best one and I must insist that you should take a guide before heading inside otherwise it will look like pile of stones here and there.

If you are not too much into science but yet want to go through all of them, it is a nice place to visit still. It is well maintained as well.

It also demonstrates Vedic astronomy's importance to ordinary people whose birth charts provides them with a letter for their name . 

We enjoyed... It is Know to be one of the Largest Jantar Mantar Of India. It is truly awesom, very peaceful and the guide was really enthusiastic who showed us around This medieval observatory is much better maintained than the one of similar name in Delhi, though I'm not sure this difference warrants coming all the way to Jaipur. I find all the town sights rather overrated, and while the Amber palace is truly impressive it... Astrology and other research equipment of huge size can be seen here. that was sponsored by Jaipur king and was made by ancient scienctist of that era.

make sure u have you water bottles and umbrella with u , because its all in open air. This is such an interesting place to go! Amazing to see, and very well maintained. If you go in hot weather, be aware that it is a very bright white place that ends up like an outdoor sauna, so dress/prepare accordingly. For those into science you'll enjoy checking out the devices in the park. Our guide explained how each worked and we were astonished with how accurate the time was on the sundial, it's almost 300 years old! This place or rather an observatory constructed by the great jaipur ruler. The attraction is the sun dial, the seasons clock and wether vein. The Jantar Mantar is proof of the genius of man before the invention of technology. Make sure you get a guide or walk around with a tour group, because it is so informative and you'll hardly understand anything without it. this is pretty cool actually. but it's best to go with a guide because the instruments are pretty confusing and there aren't really any descriptions. it's pretty interesting even if you're not a huge fan of astronomy We visited this place in the afternoon and couldn't stand in the heat of the sun. There are a lot of designed architecture. People who are interested in physics can definitely see it. We just had a look around for sometime before we exited. Don't... One can not write enough about this place as it is classical and one of the most advance observatory in its time.

It gives you an insight into how time,months and days were calculated. All about astrology and a display of large instruments.

Would definitely recommend getting a guide to explain what each one does. Although an interesting collection of huge ancient outdoor astronomical equipment, I didn't find it that exciting, maybe due to my lack of knowledge in the area. Great science was invented even before we know it existed. This place is an example. The time was accurate, on the dot. I was impressed. Must see in Jaipur. Nice souvenir shop as well within the premises. The Jantar Mantar of Jaipur is a great and interesting place to visit. Discover the many different observation instruments for sun, moon and stars, many of them as tall as a house!

It's ideal for a small stroll around and to read the many boards detailing how and why the structures have been built.

Made me wonder, that if we Indians were such scientific geniuses eons ago, why have we become so petty minded and focussing so much more on irrelevant issues such as caste and religion.

Never have I seen such a variety and complex / detailed creations.... I was so impressed... It gives an overall idea about what the city can offer. This is not that interesting for normal people without any special interest in astronomy but local guides had been able to make it an attraction. Skip it with no regrets. Not to sure what i made of this,maybe if your into astronomy then this would be an ideal place to visit.
But for me i wasnt that impressed ,maybe it was the extremely hot day. A contraption made years ago that can tell time with in two minutes.

The place is well maintained and architecturally well designed but we got totally bored and felt it a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend to visit this unless you really want to. History lovers may like this attraction. Well worth a visit. Better if on a sunny day otherwise you wont get all of the benefits. If your temples and forts this attraction is a must in Jaipur. If you want sundials and devices for plotting the course of the planets on a grand scale this is a must. The only drawback is that the science behind the various devices (all massive stone structures) is at best confusing. But its still a fascinating... Fantastic place and very good value. Can't believe that this was built over a few hundred years ago.
Thoroughly recommend a visit and for 200 R each, not an expensive visit. A must see in Jaipur. Do not forget to check the video presentation which explains the history behind the observatory and its mechanics.

Very well maintained and nurtured. A fascinating area, especially if you are a fan of astrology and/or horoscopes etc. The Raja who built this was clearly a huge fan. Its worth an hour to just stroll around and check the time on the various instruments, all accurate even today. This site is for for the science and astrology buffs, it contains a number of over sized astronomy and astrology instruments among them a 60+ ft high sun dial.
Fun fact: when you go the minor of the 2 big sun dials you will find... We saw this had a high trip advisor rating so we were excited to explore. For our group it was just so so.

But you need a guide to understand the basic functioning of the instruments. I have visited this place for light and music show,it was a impressive show with all the details .Must place to visit kids.The technology development in that era is truly appreciated. It basically tells about the physics calculations which the Vegas and the King's made during the ancient times We went here with a guide and it was really cool to see the instruments still at work.

The largest Sun Dial is accurate to 3 seconds to Greenwich mean time, which means it had to be corrected to latitude and longitude... The Very great techniques..!!!!!!!!
Very Interesting..!!!
Must try it..!!!!!!!!
You will definitely like it...!!!!! ;-) This place  is in realty a giant clock/calender calculator. It beats me how they managed to calculate and then build its gadgets with such pinpoint accuracy. Spend an hour there. Well worth a visit especially if you are into astrology The sun clocks are cool and given their sizes pretty accurate. However here is not anything impressive or extremely exciting about them. The little cafeteria/shop is good to buy cold bottled water for around $0.50. A good bargain for a tori at place. I have first time seen the Sun clock. It is amazing and thinking about Great Indians made it and want to appreciate their mind. Great place for astronomers or people that likes astronomy if not avoid it as you will have a hasrd time understading the structures.

There are several Jantar mantra, but this one in Jaipur is supposed to be the biggest of all. But I don't mind skipping it. Miss out the Palace, the Hawa Mahal and the Amber Fort, but do not miss out on the Jantar Mantar. It is without question the best thing to see in the whole of the Jaipur area. We visited on a brilliant sunny day, and all... Good place to see..

Makes you wonder if whether mankind has taken... Even the audio guide (although good) was difficult to understand for me! Also, ensure that you spend at least an hour here.

The audio guide is quite good, although it becomes a little mundane by the end. Very beautiful monuments.near from my hotel that is nahar Singh haveli hotel. It is very traditional.  And historical sites. This is a strange place - even though the sundials and instruments are hundreds of years old, it's hard to get away from the fact that the whole place looks a bit like the derelict remains of 1950's swim park! The technology is obviously impressive... Suggested to all people who are interested and would like to see how in ancient times astral object's position or time were calculated. Just take care of protecting from the sun, as it is an outdoor park and Rjasthan is not a cool place.

The signage is not great and it would be very helpful to have a guide (which are available outside). Without an interest in the types...

Visit this place if you want to see some elaborate constructions used for astronomical observation on olden days before technology.

The place closes at 5:30 PM. Expect to spend around 1 hour there. It is good to know how far the scientific intrest of people in 18th century.  Honestly, I didn't understand without a guide probably Jantar Mantar tells a lot about our ancestors and how good they are in astrology.

Make sure you go on a sunny day to experience the instruments working as intended.  It helped that I understood the science behind sundials but there are plenty of guides otherwise.  It's also a great place just for photographs.

The only thing here are various sun dials used by the royalty so they could pinpoint their exact astrological sign, but it was still interesting.

The place is nice situated near the famous city place. Its has various astronomical instruments build in the old era to track and read the astrophysics.
The area outside may have huge crowd and full of traffic at times as the road is very narrow.... This attraction is something to wonder about how they calculated planetary distances Sun direction. The structures that you see tell you various things about time. It's astonishing to see such huge structures only to keep date and time. If you don't take a guide, these structures won't make any sense.. When understood, one can't stop appreciating the accuracy of these things. Must watch The place is nice and would make an Indian proud that we had such wise and great mathematicians and architects in our country, however, for an ordinary person it gets too technical and boring.  Good place for people who have interest in mathematics, astronomy and... You can skip this option. Still if you want to go there then I suggest to go early in the morning.
Else parking will be an issue.
A guide is required to see this place. Want to be proud of India. Visit n feel proud. It is all about astronomy during ancient time. It's Damn accurate. I tested it . Trust me. Please please  visit. Don't miss it. Beautiful, scientific, mysterious, clean, heaven for photography, no pestering.
Good souvenirs shop.
Close to city palace. worth a visit -  I would recommend hiring a guide.  City palace, Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar can be covered in one go. We have traveled to a lot of places, but this is different from any we have seen. It is an array of structures that tell time down to the second by the shadows of the sun. There are other numerous astronomical instruments that will leave... Wonderful example of the great innovation and culture from Indi culture. Its amazing  Must visit place!! This place is known for its mathematical measurements importance. If you are into celistical objects, time derivation and lat-long significance visit it. Its worth it. This site is best to be seen with Tourist Guide or a manual. There are artifacts that show the current Nakshatra, Time, and many more related to Astronomy and astrology. 

A good visit for school children to understand the principles. This is a piece of excellence of older times. Makes you feel awesome and proud of our own heritage. Must visit specially on good sunny day. A great place to go with kids and see the ingenuity of a young Raj who studied science and astrology. It is clean, well maintained and peaceful.  Beautiful views of fort in background. The sheer scale of this astronomical observatory is amazing.
When you discover the accuracy of the measurements you'll be even more amazed. This is a very interesting site to visit and to check the genius people at the 18th century and how they were calculating time and defining astrology. You will be fascinated We didn't enjoyed a lot here but it has historical values so one shud not skip it... Only issue is lot of trouble with parking. We had a full day tour from rtdc so had a guide with us. It is worth visiting if you are into trivia and there is someone with you who can explain the structures and their working. Otherwise one would not be able to understand... These structures to track the movement of the sun and the planets for the purpose of casting horoscopes were so interesting.  How anyone worked out how to build them is a mystery.  A sundial accurate to within 20 seconds is an amazing structure to have... it is good place particularly for the people interested in jyotishi and ancient monuments it is in mid of city Go with a guide. Great to see how astronomy and astrology were intertwined. Exhibits show application of science. Must visit. Definitely need a guide to understand Jantar Mantar. Beautiful structures with astronomical and astrological value. Home to the largest sun dial clock. This is a must visit. Do not forget to take a Guide. Without the guide you will understand nothing. It will take about 45 minutes to see the place. Take an identity card for your child below 15 years to get a heavy discount. understand this may not be for all unless you have a specific interest I found it  nice way to spend an hour or so before hitting the hawa mahal A must see for visitors to the Pink City. It shows the advances of India in astronomy almost 300 years back. The place is maintained quite well. But, it is closed in the evenings/nights, so visitors cannot use some of the ""apparatus"". We absolutely loved visiting this astronomy garden! Incredible instruments with awesome accuracy- one of the coolest places to visit in Jaipur! Make sure to get a guide to understand how each life size instrument works It is a very nice place to visit, but you NEED A GUIDE. Otherwise you will not enjoy the visit. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Jaipur. We could have spent a full day exploring this incredible place.  The observatory, completed in 1728 A.D., is the largest and best preserved, and is often called one of the seven wonders of India.  It boast the largest sundial in the world, which is incredibly... This UNESCO World Heritage site is a must visit even if you have visited the Delhi version of this one. The attractions of the location is the gigantic astronomical instruments made of stone and brass. This location has the world’s largest sundial, allowing the visitor... A must visit place... Especially for all those who have interest in History and Astronomy...
It's great to know that the calculations done on those structures are accurate even today.. Enjoyed every moment there. Well maintained monument.. Traveling with teenagers does pose a challenge to keep them interested.
This attraction did just that. Looking at all the different instruments that were built and the different purposes kept them interested, the guide also made it very infirmative For an engineering nut this place would be awesome.  For someone wanting to understand the history if it (and the other copies across India) I was a bit bored.

I possibly needed a tour guide that offered more value than pointing to things and reciting... Very interesting to see. Unique experience to view instrumentation used so long ago. It was very hot though and there is little shade. The attraction is quite busy and there are lots of people around the instruments. You need a very good guide to explain... Pretty interesting story and tools - but overall a really small place and could use time elsewhere... One of the must-see tourist attractions in Jaipur. Students and those keen on knowing some astronomical facts, how time was calculated (which still works accurate even today) etc. must visit this attraction. It was linked to old Science technology. Take Guide for better understanding. It has biggest Sun Dial in world. Must visit thing to do jantar mantar is place which makes us feel that how intelligent people was there in that time.if you dont take guide you will not able to undestand anything but when you come to know about thing,you will be amazed. Similar to other Jantar Mantars. Didn't find anything unique or interesting. Good for first time visitors. I have no idea of astronomy or astrology, but this place had me gripped for more than 2 hours. It was a mesmerizing out-of-world feeling. It was as if stepping back in history, although nothing is in ruins here. Everything is well maintained and tip-top... Awesome place and you will be in awe to know how knowledgeable our kings and the then scientists..  Don't hesitate to hire a guide with out which visiting this place is utter waste. I don't know anything about astronomy/astrology nor had I have any interest in any one of those two. Still, for me it was a great visit. I read other reviews before visiting and I couldn't agree more to those saying that one should have a... Must go in Jaipur. Learn how advanced astronomy was in past India. Very interesting history...architecture.... building. Good place to learn about space-stars-astro events-time for kids and interested adults too. I know latitude and longitude, declination and time are all old hat to us in the google maps generation, but in 1728, this was a feat of astronomical engineering and sculpture.  Very impressive, we had a great time creating very modern looking photos--hard to believe... Visited with my two kids aged 4 & 6. The place has got hundreds of years old sun clocks which are working accurately till date and has the world's biggest sun clock.

Must have a guide to understand how these clocks work.

A must see... One shall not understand almost each and everything that's on display here. 
But that's the beauty, because our ancestors, they did long back.

Take your time to read each and every instrument here. The Jantar Mantar can be translated as 'instrument of calculation' It is a collection of architectural astronomical instruments built by Sawai Jai Singh in 1716 and it was completed in 1728. He built five such observatories including those at Delhi and Varanasi . After years... It shows, how intelligent the kings of that time were. It is no less than a celestial observatory. I was really happy to see whatever I had once read in History books! Jantar Mantar is nothing short of Amazing! There are on-site specialist guides who will stagger you with the information they provide. This site is so different from anything else, that it becomes ""must see"". Camera, brain in gear, look, listen, awe! We were awe strict with the scale, science, brains behind the creation. Our guide was highly knowledgeable and explained each and every thing in details. 

Children also got an opportunity to read the angles, check the time with the shining sun, the rashi from the... It is wonderful to know that what amount of engineering, astronomical knowledge our predecessors have. It is just unbelievable that in those ancient days, such precision could be achieved. Amazed to see that India's ancient astrology and science was so great that they built sun watch which shows time with 2 seconds accuracy almost 300 years ago. It also shows astrology so accurately that can amaze anyone to even think how were they able... Incredible to imagine what outstanding precision Raja Man Singh managed to deliver through his instruments. Truly incredible One of the must seeings at Jaipur. Hire a guide who can explain the equipment functionalities. It is adjacent to the City Palace so both can be covered at once. I liked this place very much. I traveled here with my wife and we were both happy to see this place. You may need guide here as you  dont understand what the equipments are and if you are interested to know them. The Place truly depicts the historical science heritage of Indian astronomy and astrology. For a true experience you must take audio guide or personal guide who will tour you to entire campus and explain each and every structure. We are astonished The Guide Provided By Rajputana Trawels explained minutely .It is a wonder Astronamy. Located in the centre of town, next to the City Palace. It is open between 9am and 4:30pm. Tickets are Rs100 for foreigners. It is a relatively quiet tranquil location.
Whilst each of the exhibits has a small description, if you want to get the... It's a magical place.. Where u can find al d old clocks related to sun.. How in old time people c time.. How they count.. How they know which month is going on.. Which season is coming.. What is d time .. Wen sun wl... Visited Jantar Mantar during the current visit and it seemed a total waste since I have already visited Jantar Mantar at Delhi. No need to visit if you have seen Jantar Mantar at any other city. It's a very interesting spot, recommended to go early in the morning to avoid traffic. And I advise you to read about each astrological instrument or have a guide to understand the techniques. One has to visit the place without the second thought. The place is simply superb. Dont miss this when you visit Jaipur. Quite interesting.  If you want to enjoy and explore this place, get a guide. It was a hot day for me. Jantar Mantar is an example of how advanced we have been since ancient times...built around 300 years ago, the instruments made of stones still work perfectly. The huge time clocks still give the correct local time upto an accuracy of 20s which is just awesome.... Visited today on a composite ticket with other attractions. I like astrology so this was a nice stop next to the city palace. Much nicer than the Jantar Mantar in Delhi! This is just a fascinating place to visit. The skill in building these advance astronomical instruments gives an insight into the culture of India. As said before it really is worth having a guide to show you around and give you a full understanding of... Maybe we should have gotten a guide, but our self-guided tour of Jantar Mantar left a lot to be desired. It seemed like every explanation of each different ""instrument"" started with the same paragraph and we didn't find it all that interesting. Teenagers sat and... We enjoyed our visit to Jantar. It was great seeing the array of time pieces which amount to spectacular and accurate sun dials. There are boards that explain what things are. Otherwise it would seem all a bit bizarre. This observatory is a very interesting place to visit however you need to have a guide to explain what the various structures do as unless you are an astronomy expert you will never figure it out for yourself.  Our guide was very good in explaining... This really opened our eyes to the fact that a King can also be intelligent and had a scientific leaning..whoever had heard that 400 years ago India had prepared sundials, calculated distances between planets, predicted and calculated eclipses etc...We were spell bound. Best to take... World heritage, and probably well deserved, as we have never seen such collection together. Our tour guide was quite knowlegdeable, but everything is well signposted The first thing this iconic series of buildings that comprise the observatory brings to mind is the science behind the structures. There is a wealth and depth of astronomy out here, and much to be learnt. This is very interesting and must visit place. It has collection of architectural astronomical instruments that give insight of how our ancestors researched on the space, calculate day, time, year, etc. Good for mid aged children as well to learn. If you love the stars, then this is a must visit. I was amazed by the different equipment setups there. It is astounding to realize the accuracy of the equipment.  One of the highly recommended place for the nerds. In front of Hawa Mahal and beside of City palace.. Not much attracted as Delhi's jantar Mantar..
If you  have a time gap then you can visit here..
Simple magically build w..Specially for astrologer and deep thinkers ..... One of the most interesting astronomical building - the time teller building of Jaipur. It is a must visit for science lovers.
It is bigger than the jantar mantar at Delhi. Get the guide to understand the place better..
It has been constructed scientifically and gives you an idea of how rich was the knowledge of our Indian people in that era of time.. Great place and very interesting, although slightly overpriced at 300 rupees for foreigners plus extra for the audioguide. Just had a quick visit to this place as it was opposite to the city palace.

Can spend 30 min at this place. I may be a philistine but unless you are heavily into astrology it just a bunch of weirdly shaped structures, sadly as so often in India there is no explanation to there function which is a shame. This place is recommended for people who have interest in time calculation mathematics and horoscope. It's amazing to see the fact that based on the sun light falling on stone they are telling sun god is residing on which rashi. Worth visiting this place. More... A must visit part of the tour, a GUIDE is  necessary  they charge a minimum of 200 Indian rupees. the clock, the astronomical science and the zodiac signs are a wonder ,how the kings of jaipur worked on this theory , for astrology and weather... It is right next to the City Palace so it is worth the visit. I don't have any knowledge of astrology so found it quite confusing. The Jantar Mantar is a fantastic piece of brilliant design & astronmical brick & marble devices for measuring all sorts of astronomical event. The largest sundial in the world is situated here. This is really worth a long visit to get the best of the... Even though I'm not into astronomy, this attraction is well worth a visit. For me the most impressive feature are the giant sundials where you can see the shadow moving and tell the time to within seconds - at least on a sunny day! When our guide proposed the we go to see ""the Observatory"" , I was underwhelmed. It was very hot and I thought of somewhere high where we would gaze through telescopes etc.
But the reality of the observatory - Jantar Mantar is totally different. Ok... There is a little visitor centre at the back which is not really highlighted but it will give you a good overview of what the instruments were trying to measure. Overall nice but not great Very interesting - difficult to understand how they could achieve such accuracy without the benefit of modern day technology Tourists who didn't know the history of this site (or didn't have an expert guide) would probably scratch their head on walking through the gates and think they'd walked into an Escher theme park.  It is fascinating to have all the instruments explained, but you... visitors or tourists who are scientifically inclined will love this place .the accuracy of the dials is very good.you definitely should take a guide who can explain how the device work..do take a cap as it is outdoors.you can club this with seeing city palace... This is a very interesting monument to visit.  It is a collection of 19th century astronomical instruments, and features the world's largest sundial which is still accurate to two-tenths of a second.  Our guide was so helpful in explaining each instrument.  I was amazed. It's... Want to know how our older generation used to write the birth chart, horoscope and figure out the exact time, visit this interesting place. Make sure to hire a guide. situated near the centre of the town you can reach it by auto or bus.
nice place provides you knowledge about ancient indian astronomy. U can't miss the Jantar Mantar.... A collection of various larger than life 19 archaeological equipments for astronomy. Even if u are not interested in the study, visit this to admire the sheer genius of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh in the 18th century. The sundial... I really enjoyed the trip. overall it was good and full of thrill. Will look another trip with them. It's located right near the City Palace, takes a few minutes to walk in. You can rent audio guide or just read the brochure.
Entrance can be purchased separately for 200 INR or it's included in City Palace ticket. I well enjoyed the jantar mantar, great for astronomers, tools used to measure the skies, and next to the city palace, you can get a ticket to enter all sites for 1000 rs if you do them all in one day, includes all forts, city... This is the largest stone observatory in the world. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It  is a collection of nineteen century architectural astronomical instruments. It might be a bit boring for younger kids. I know that this may be sacrilege to say, but whilst recognising the genius at work here, it was unable to press any buttons at all. I just didn't get it at all. It may be because the signs were not great and whilst our... amazing place, you d better get a guide if you are non scientist, coz some of the instruments a quite diffucult to understand.  dont miss this, especially on a sunny day Though its hard for non-science background ppl to understand its a must visit. Very precise with the starts and lunar calculation. Summer visit is bit tough as sunlight is unbearable and you need minimum 2Hrs to visit this place. I can't believe it thet were so advanced and technical they are put in parts one will work one hour or month only........................... It's awsome.............. Its a good place to visit.. i had a composite ticket that covered the cost of jantar mantar.. composite ticket costed me 200 rupees (foreigner and student)
I liked the fact how our science has developed with years.. there are 2 sun clocks in that... What a place to visit! In ancient time we had such rulers who themselves were truly genius. The guides there are also very competent to make you understand every calculation. You must give ample time to the place. Will not share the details so you... You can whole away a few hours in this amazing observatory. The story of the maharaja that established it is fascinating. The equipment at the observatory is all stone/marble and works today as it did do centuries ago. Well ahead of its time! How ironic that IST is often taken to mean Indian Stretch Time. But here was a king who wanted to know time down to the seconds.

There is a lot of science here. interesting place get back into physics.another great work from ancient indians workers. dont miss it . Very interesting to see but a lot of information to take in and try to remember, and pictures to take of course. This is way better than the jantar mantar in Delhi both in scale and aesthetics. If you want to know more about each instrument, get an audio guide. Try to go there in the evening as afternoon is a very hot time and it was... Nice place But to expensive. All towers are closed so it's not really possible to explore. Unfriendly staff This is a must see sight if you visit Jaipur. If you have any interest in mathematics, astrology and/or architecture do not skip this site. Jantar Mantar (JM) is the largest and best preserved of the five observatory that houses outsized astronomical instruments that are still in use today. There are also the 12 zodiac signs each and individually situated inside next to each other to understand the movements of... There are plenty of plaques around the site but they are a bit dry and technical.  They don't tell you the history both of how this site came to be and how it was used.  You really need a good guide for that.  The site... This is the largest of a number of Jantar Mantars in the Golden Triangle, which have been aptly if irreverently described as a cross between a skateboard park and one of M.C.Escher's impossible cityscapes.  If you don't have much understanding or interest in astronomical observations... Nothing to see. The equipment are good . without a guide u ll understand nothing . and all guides are cheats. Cab people are bigger cheats How is this place not one of the wonders of the world?!  I was truly taken by this place.  It is basically a collection of sun-dials and other astronomical measuring instruments that blew my mind.  I have quite a scientific mind, so I could really... These instruments are deceptively simple for such scientific accuracy. I am impressed by what man can achieve. This is truly an amazing stop- if only to realize how long all civilizations have sought to understand the stars A great place to visit, The entry fee was nominal and the observatory was quite clean, compared to the Delhi Jantar Mantar, You must take a guide if you visit first time. I have visited earlier also but this time I found its much cleaner... If you're into astronomy then don't miss this, or even into the science of prediction. We didn't have a guide and I think you need to to appreciate what you're looking at. The signs are not great, and there aren't many of them! It's really... One of the coveted world heritage sites, Jantar Mantar is a must visit landmark of the pink city. To fully appreciate its significance, one must take the services of an authentic guide, otherwise the visit would be futile. Everything looked pretty neat, but once you were there for a few minutes it got a bit boring. Best part was sneaking into a school field trip group. I never thought that calculations from time to zodiac signs could be firmed with the help of Sun and Shade. This is amazing and Raja Jai Singh the creator of Jaipur had great knowledge about astronomy and the science. He made many scientific constructions and... This is an amazing place but very obtrusive signs get in the way of some wonderful geometric designs. It's astounding human achievement but  a few raised platforms would give you smooch better a view of this.  It is worth the small entrance fee £2 Quite interesting for a short visit but becomes a little same as each object is used for astronomical purposes. You need a good guide to explain things. How the people hundreds of years back could tell time or predict eclipse and other astronomical events has always baffled us. A visit to Jantar Mantar provides answers to some of these baffling questions. Now this is supposed to be an excellent place and it probably is but I could not get it. Dont bother taking the audio guide (its bad, only increases your confusion). With a human guide, he/she has to be really knowledgeable to explain the functions... I went here with my tour guide and he knew so much about it - it was amazing to learn. 

There are lots of 'instruments' used to tell the time, astrology, weather, latitude/longitude etc. 

Entrance 200 rupees Nice place to visit, whenever you are in Jaipur, must visit place for Jantar and Mantar,, many times visited this place We did not hire a guide so maybe this is why we did not enjoy it very much. There is very few signs explaining what you are looking at. Therefore, if you are planning to visit, do hire a guide, otherwise it is not worth... If you are into space and time this is the place for you. There are instruments that will leave you baffled. It's all to do with space and positioning. The exhibits are spectacular but you need a degree to understand half of them. A must... This place shows how great Indian astronomers, astrologers and mathematicians were. The accurate calculation of distance and size of not only moon but start, the 12 month clocks place. The Sun clock and also the moon clock, more over the eclipse tool that tells which... If you're an engineer or scientist or science-enthusiast, you might find this attraction worthwhile. Otherwise, you might as well skip it. This place is a testimony of mathematical/Astro and scientific advancements that our country had far before others had. Do surely hire a guide. Experience is mesmerising. loved the accuracy of time . it was made so many years ago which proves the rich knowledge of our country . Constructed by king with great value but its only to SEE attraction as non of the observatory is in working condition, neither guide shows how it can be useful. This place is a must visit for people who have any interest in astronomy or astrology. Take your time see the magnificent instruments on display and feel amazed at the depth of knowledge that existed a few centuries ago. The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is the first I have visited in India, and might I say, it's a must have experience! I was literally and figuratively blown away by the technological advances made in astrology by the maharaja. I was so excited I would... This is a very interesting place. One needs to go there when he has some good time as this place cannot be explored within a short time. Anybody who has interest in science would be fascinated by the place. Each of the equipment is very... Jantar Mantar is definitely a place from future ... built in past. The astronomical clocks and sun dials are absolutely a piece of technology built centuries ago. The accuracy of the main sun dial is down to 2 seconds and other clocks showing sun signs...... The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is considered to be the largest of the five observatories built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh. The astronomical observatory has instruments for measuring time, tracking constellations, observing the orbits around the sun, etc. But, will work only in day with... If you are limited on time - it is better to skip this attraction - you can get it by viewing it on internet or reading about it. I really appreciate the accuracy with which the astronomical instruments were built at that period of time. It has 19 instruments and features the world's largest stone sundial.  Worth a visit. Its a nice park kind of place. Clock of old time.how kings used to calculate the time  . bhool bhulaiya is fun overall. park is maintained and kids especially loved it. This was really interesting to me.  Lots of space to  move around.  You can get off your feet and watch a film that does a better job of explaining things. They have sun-dial type things that are accurate to 2 seconds.  I would forgo a... This is an interesting site; however it is recommended that one has a guide to fully appreciate the complexity of these constructions and how they are intended to be viewed. I am sure there are a lot of people who would enjoy this and I suppose the attraction is how advanced they were with time, stars etc. Something different , although quite difficult to understand the exact way the instruments operate due to my inquisite nature, probably some video (paid) could help people understanding how exactly each instrument helped back then. Some history and presently how it is done. But a nice... Awesome place to visit.. U will be amazed am sure.. The construction is so accurate at those times.. Fantastic...!!!!!! I love places like this! I'm so impressed by peoples knowled and the fact that theese structures were build a long time ago! Must see!!! If you are interested in different ways to discover sundials and how smart the old indians were you should visit this place. Its clean and in the city of Jaipur. without a guide, it is very difficult to make out what all the instruments were used for. Our guide brought it to life, and made it interesting. Jantar-Mantar is Jaipur's astro- head quarters with the age old instruments to study astronomy being on display to the public.
It is very critical to get a tour guide to visit this place, as most of the instruments would need some basic information to know... It takes at least 60 minutes to understand and gain insight of the various instruments present at this attraction. This is one of the few, if not the only operational Jantar-Mantar observatories in India, Would strongly recommend employing the services of a tour guide at... Amazing! One needs to take a the Guide inside the premises. Local guides provided by the travel companies may not be able to give the details properly for all the apparatus there. Jantar Mantar on a whole only shows how advanced our Astronomical study was... This is an astronomical marvel. The 19 main astronomical instruments  are fascinating. especially considering the century that it was built in.  The audio guide helped us decipher each of those, without which we would have been lost. Incredible. Definitely worth a visit. We visited this place without any assistance of the guide. However to understand the monuments and its utility, purpose one need guidance. Otherwise it will be just another structure. Evening is best time to visit this place Could not believe that our anchesters constructed such a scientific model for time calculation, It still shows the correct time so many centuries later These astronomical structures, including the tallest sundial in the world, were built from 1728-1733, and they are a must-see for anyone interested in astronomy or the development of science in India.  The variety of these large instruments, as well as their accuracy, provide impressive evidence... This place is flooded with tourists from all around the world.One gets an opportunity to peek into the marvelous dials and the science behind the construction of this herculean project.The place is well-maintained and plethora of information is available through guides and booklets. One can...

Must visit place in Jaipur, Makes you proud that India was ahead of West in the past. Make sure you get a good guide who explains you in detail I was totally amazed  by this place. What our ancestors did before the science and technology. It proves science is not a modern thing and date back to centuries ago. A guide is a must to understand this place else nothing will make sense.
Must... Similar to the one in Delhi, this attraction is worth visiting for nothing else other than to marvel at our ancestors ingenuity... However it's not overly exciting and shouldn't take much longer than 45mins . Come here if you have nothing else to visit (which... even if you believe in the total tosh that is astrology this place will fascinate.  How ever were these amazing precision calculating machines ever realised?  But these amazing men - they would have been men - who built them to chart the movements of the... like nothing ive ever seen - so interesting to see how india was developing insights into time and distance of stars at such an early time - absoutely fascinating.  take audio guide if you want to reaaly understand how some of them work! A really great place to visit to take interesting 'different' photos of India, and to explore the history of science in India. A lot has been restored but this doesn't detract. This is a good thing for students.
They can study .
It is good but if u not take a guide it is very bad. It is not possible to understand without guide.
I lyk this place . ....... They have an ipad-based audio tour guide that explains all the complicated YANTRAS (instruments). It is amazing that hundreds of years back without computers they were so accurate in mapping the universe. Lots of students gets the topic about Jantar Mantar and Hawa mahel when it comes to jaipur. Jantar Mantar is a good place with historical  importance. Different kind of huge clocks working with the help of sunlight. Most important is to get a guide along... II recommend getting a guide when you come here, they will explain all the different structures and how to read them Much better impresion that in the photos. To learn how they analised the astrology while walking in an open area was very relaxing. Not croudy. This place may seem ordinary on first look. But when you will see in details, you will be surprised How great technologies Indians had in the 17th Century to monitor the Cosoms.
Worlds Largest Sun Dial can spot here alongwith many other fascinating Man Made... It's very close to city palace and hawa mahal. Do hire the services of a guide who will explain the meaning of the apparatus constructed..showing various things like longitude/ lattitude/ zodiac zone etc. It's an interesting place to go to and shouldn't be missed while... visited jantar mantar during my trip to jaipur.nice place...........Nice place to know about Jay singh , one will enjoy the architecture of sun sign. Light and sound in evening is ok It's not the structures itself that amazed me (although, admittedly, they are worth just admiring from a distance) but the science behind it. It's just insane that people used this for actual calculations and stuff. Once you read the use of each instrument there, you... Jantar Mantar translates to ""calculating instrument"" loosely.  The huge sundials and other parts of the architecture were designed to tell time (some with 2 sec accuracy) to the constellations in the  sky. I would recommend it folks who have an interest in this field.  Might... This is really part of the Indian culture : the sun, the stars, the zodiac signs. All this was really made with accuracy. You spend about 1/2 hour on that site but is is really interesting. Built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, from 1724 onwards, and is one of five built by him, as he was given by Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah the task of revising the calendar and astronomical tables.

You always surprise to know the concept of knowing  time, season and astrology through these monuments. This is similar to the one in New Delhi  - lots of sundials and other astronomical instruments.

However it can get quite busy with tour groups and is not that large so perhaps go early to get the best of it. One can not stop wondering how without any modern scientific instruments the astronomers perfected the skill of locating the exact path of stars and heavenly bodies with these simple instruments under the king's patronage If you're looking for a break from the hustle and bustle, spending some time wandering around the astronomical gardens is a great respite.

It was almost a revisit to Delhi Jantar Mantar but this one is the first one. Great place.

Needs to be preserved. Very interesting astronomical observatory. We had a personal guide that explained things to us in great detail. A very interesting place and for once it's worth it to ask for a(n official) guide. Impressive instruments to look t the moon, sun and stars. The site has enough English signage to understand the various structures. The audio guide is painfully long and irritating in the extreme with a father daughter conversation along the lines of, ""Why, Daddy...?"" Do not bother with it. The roads to Jantar Mantar are crappy (literally, if you get my meaning). But once inside, it's like you're in another world.

Clean and beautiful, Jantar Mantar is a reminder that great science and knowledge existed, long before smartphones and apps :)

But don't take... The Jantar Mantar is a collection of architectural astronomical instruments, built by Sawai Jai Singh........... I was amazed to see Scientifically designed physical structures.

There are a variety of sun dials and even moon clocks and devices to measure star signs. I was reliably informed that... The name of the site translates as Calculation Instrument.

Nice place. Though the Tourist guides are available at gate on payment basis, but I think Tourism authority could take initiative to arrange some shows in Jantar Mantars to attract the tourist by describing the functions.

Most certainly a must see in Jaipur. Get yourself a guide who knows his stuff. Make sure you have a good guide to explain all the technicalities of the instruments and constructions - ours was great so we had a really fun visit. This was okay as the science behind it is not clearly told to us.Nor are the explanations and maintenance great. Probably we should have visited the light and sound show but could not due to time constraints I enjoyed this UNESCO site... I'm a geek and I like this kind of thing.  The various sundials and astrology monitoring devices were neat.  My wife thought it was all stupid stuff.  So that why we rated it as only 4 dots....

It was build more then two centuries before and what a perfect display of calculating time depending on the Sun movement.

It is highly appreciable to see what our ancestors knew and how  professional they were those days.

The Jantar Mantar observatory has fourteen major geometric devices for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking stars.very huge instuments for astronomical calculations, a must see and adore. Good to see how science flourished in 17th century India. The sundials and other yantras are worth your money! very interesting place, its better to take a guide there to have good explanation about  how machines works - how people used this astronomical observatory. An astronomical delight... I think a student of astronomy will enjoy this place more ... you need a guide to understand the nuances of this place and get one so that you can enjoy this splendid sturcture which was build many years ago with great... Loved it!! Lots of mystery and history surrounding this area. 

Lots of astronomicals instruments are found here, I recommend taking a guide though if you really want to enjoy this area and properly understand the use of each instument. 

The city palace is just nearby... Make sure you take an audio guide or a real one! Otherwise the place wont make much of a sense. Make it a point to visit the sound and light show in the evenings.

Very close to the palace. Avoid shopping in and around and... This is one of the working sundials made by Sawai Jai Singh in the 17th Century. This literally means Instruments of Calculation & it awes one to realise we are between such huge sundials & Calculators of Astrological positions.

It tickles ones fancy that when... This place is beside city palace of Jaipur. Make sure you get a good guide fot this place. November to February is the best time for visiting this place. Its mind boggling to see what was made at Jantar Mantar, in a time with no modern science or equipment, holy men created this spot to predict weather and could determine the time to the second based on these majestic structures.  As an adult, I... very interesting place - liked that it wasnt a long or confusing visit.
All astronomical instruments are properly described in English and hindi languages. Don't understand anything about the 14 monuments. You need to take the guide but only a few look knowledgeable. 

You can see the pictures of the monuments, they are just the same and frankly you don't understand anything.

I was wondering why was this place... An excellent example of using ved & science when there were no computers. Unfortunately only 6 out of 11 equipments were working, but very interesting calculation. Also had two sets of earth dials one for training and another for examination if your around the area this little attraction is quite unique and a cool place to visit

the history of the instruments dates back so so long ago and the scale and accuracy that is still shown today in this instruments is a marvel at... it was nice to see an observatory in Jaipur. very good combination of astrology and science. this observatory would be good if you will have a guide with you . very nice impression of Jaipur. Medieval kings, between wars, turned their sights on distant objects. Jai Singh was one such Rajasthani king who ordered the building of brick and mortar instruments to study the celestial objects.Built in early 18th century the king and his scholarly courtiers must have spent hours... Great place. We had a very good guide who explained each instrument thoroughly. It's worthwhile getting a guide for this place. A very historic yet relatively new, this place takes you back in time in the most modest and simple way. With the means of measurement of sky, when stars, zodiacs and time were measured with the most precise and accurate methods. 
The place is filled... We did Jantar Mantar as part of an organised tour and was one of the places I thought would be quite boring. However, I found it incredibly interesting. It is amazing that these instruments were made so long ago and are still so accurate. The... If you have visited Jantar Mantar in Delhi then like I said one can always skip if they are on short span of time but if you have not then try add it to your planning it's just next to City Palace which I believe... One the Best Place to visit in Jaipur , when ever you are coming to Jaipur Need to contact AMR Prime Hospitality Team , They are the best Organizer for the Holidays , they are Master for the same Visit the attraction with a guide.It is an open air observatory.Imagine around 286 years back they installed sundial which was known for showing time accurately even today.The instruments are made of stone and marble  and are all masterpieces. Now this is a monument which you should not give a miss when in Jaipur. The sundials and the precision of their calculations will leave you asking for more information about it's history. Nice place to visit from knowledge prospectiv as it gives you prospective about getting time in history. Besides its name, which provides hours of pronunciation-fun (we settled on Junter Munter), this astronomical park full of whopping, wacky instruments is one of the Pink City's finest sights. Jai Singh's indulgent hobby provided his capital with an alarmingly futuristic, proto-sculpture park which is a... A guide is a must as he will explain you and you will learn a lot and the visit will be much much more rewarding The observatory is a few hundred years old and some of instruments are still working. I particularly liked the sundial which can still tell the time to an accuracy of half a minute. It was interesting to see these huge sun dials etc. But unfortunately, it was raining while we were there. As our guide said, ""No sun, no fun."" But still cool to see them and think of the folks designing them so long ago. A must see in Jaipur and the biggest in India. I was lucky enough to visit it with the holy sun shining brightly in the sky, although its scorchingly hot, my local tour guide, Sanjay, explained and demonstrated each instrument and since its ancient-old, you'll... Good place for science enthusiasts . Highly recommend to  take guide to better understand the different monuments and designs in jantar mantar The science behind every instrument will blow your mind. Must take a guide who can explain you better. its a place , where it gives knowledge on time dated back to where technology was not even its starting stage , the curiousity of how time was calculated Keep ample of hours with you while visiting Jantar Mantar if you need to understand various device used by our ancestor. Its good to see brains behind these devices.....Its very informative heritage site. Well, frankly am not a astronomy fact follower. however every human being is curiosu by nature.
the concrete structures of varied size, shape, structure really make u wonder whts on.
i had taken in the audio guide for the place.  no human guides as it... Liked: The scale and accuracy of construction of the instruments.Just a fun place to wander in.
Disliked: the brainless rules about not exiting through the gate you entered by, despite the fact that there is no turnstile or any other impediment. But no doubt it... It is a matter of pride that ancient India had such intelligent people who designed an observatory so accurate. The place is very well kept and offers good view of the city around. we went dere after visiting Hawa Mahal. purchase a composite ticket. it is a well maintained and one of d grt place to click photos.. views are amazing bt at times it become quiet boring dere with frnds.. just see and observe. That's it. Hatss... Even if you don't like astronomy, you must visit this part: astonishing what they realized to calculate the time ( 2 seconds mistake), weather forecast,…..There are about 16 huge instruments that were build for that purpose. Amazing to know how much science was known in India before anyone in the west. Suggest - get a guide, official guides available at the site. Just outside the Jaipur City Palace, this observatory was interesting, especially the large sun dial! Wow, yet another gem, astronomy is not my thing but you cannot help but admire the incredible workmanship and dedication of the creator.
Our guide made the different exhibits come alive with his knowledge of these beautiful and unique pieces of working art. We made a mistake taking a person as guide, we should have taken an Audio guide, because they are, I feel, more authentic about the details of a place. All in all, it is well maintained and worth seeing. It is awesome to know that the technology of time,horoscope etc has been used way before our modern times. It is nice to know that something we take for granted today,was a big deal then, so we can appreciate better.
This place is very informative... This is the largest of the medieval observatories in India and in working condition. The audio guide is of course of poor quality - it was more like a lecture to school children explaining physical phenomenon and definitely uninteresting for tourists. Moreover it does not... I felt like I was walking around just to see a grown man's toys, but it was very nice to see them. The site is well laid out. You will enjoy this even if you are not into astronomy. It's surely an amazing site of historic and scientific value, but the explanations on the signs and audio guide were completely beyond my grasp (and I am not stupid or uneducated, just not into science beyond high school). I saw some others giving up as... Its like any other Jantar Mantar. Those things might have special value during the time it was built but in the current times it seems pretty boring to be out in the sun and see magnanimous structures like the ones in here. Would say, its okay and skip this if you don't want to go out in sun, this place doesn't have much except to sun and moon We had a guide and the walk around was very well worth the visit.  Such an interesting historical location.  The access to the structures was surprisingly relaxed- great for picture taking. read up about this place before you go, it will make it more interesting our guide was rushing us a little.

All in all for 200 ruppees worth a visit right next to city palace and hawa mahal This is so fascinating.  It is in the open so go early as it gets very hot in the afternoon.  But do take time to have a good wander around. The attraction shows the ability of Indians in the astronomical sense. The scale of the instruments are breathtaking and the attention to detail and accuracy is phenomenal. Jantar Mantar is one of those places that just astounds the imagination with the depth, complexity and application of knowledge exhibited so long ago. The various time and astrological devices are amazing. There is a low cost audio guide available which gives you a detailed... I assumed this would be an indoor museum, I didn't realize it was an outdoor activity. Fascinating collection -- but with no shade, get there early before it gets too hot! Its a must visit place to see 16th century engineering which is wonder and makes you wow. Its a heritage place and must visit If you need a place to let you know how unintelligent you are, then you've found it! This museum is filled with time and astrological pieces dating back 300 years. The sun dials can tell time correctly with a 20 second variance. The precision etched... Nice to see attraction if you have spare time of no use. A duplicate monument what we found in Delhi. Very interesting to see the astonomical tools evolved during early  16th Century when no industrial revolution. I am not much into astronomical pieces.  The big objects displayed here may be impressive to some but not to me.  It may also help if you take a guide with you.  I did not so I may not be best reviewer for this location. An absolute marvel in terms of architecture and scientific significance. It gives you the time of the day to the nearest 20 seconds. A good guide is a must to ensure everything is explained well. very interesting place to visit, it's right beside the City Palace so if you have 20-30 minutes to spare after your palace visit then do drop by. But if you have limited time, then I guess you're better off just marveling at the City Palace... Fascinating pieces of architecture built in the early 1700s, predicting the onset of the monsoons, horoscopes, lunar and solar times and more. Not to be missed! Observing the varous astronomical devices is interesting and the setting is attractive.  expect crowds. A good selection of giant astronomical instruments, well preserved and with an audio guide available to explain how they work. A lot better than the version in Delhi. Constructed by Sawai Jai Singh in the 1600-1700's this is a Jaipur site not to be missed. The gigantic sundials and and star-tracking devices in the astrological/astronomical courtyard are still precise today. Truly an amazing feat for the Maharajah. This is one of five and... Something like this actually needs some special understanding. But interestingly these people were very smart. They were able to do things very scientifically and were able to predicts things pretty accurately!!! Its a jaw dropping collection of ancient astronomy and astrology knowledge. You will be astonished to see the instruments which work accurately even today. There are more than 40 instruments in this premise along with world’s largest Surya Stamba (Sun Stand). Never miss this place... I'm not in to science at all but this place was amazing. Not only beautiful to look at but fascinating too. Our guide did a great job of explaining how the various devices worked and it really made you think. If you go to Jaipur...

It does not take but about an hour to see thoroughly, but it is worth the visit.  Do get a good guide... without one, this...

Famous for its many little windows, this is best appreciated from outside the sprawling complex of palaces etc. Really didn't anticipate how good this would be.

A lovely clean place with lots to see and experiment with and largely free of hawkers - a definite... The history of Indian Astrology displayed via ancient instruments that are large enough to tour, touch and see.

Only when you get close to these structures do you appreciate that they are very precise scientific instruments built on a very large scale.   Be sure to wear... I teach Earth & Space Sciences and really wanted to see the observatory.  It was more than I could have hoped for.  Looking like futuristic sculptures, the astronomical and astrological instruments were awe inspiring.

The largest... What a great place is this, it is wildly spread and seems to be better than the one in Delhi or else where. This collection of giant scientific instruments is really impressive.

When the guide went of explaining the wonderful and meaningful creation of the olden era, one would simply not believe and would be left dumb stuck There were no clear signs leading towards it after seeing the ManSingh Musuem so we walked out the entire complex and then learnt it was inside on the other end of the complex. Note: keep a look out for signs. But luckily we were able...

Must visit place if you are in Jaipur :) I guess this the second thing Jaipur has better than Delhi, beside Shesh Mahal. Clean, the audio guide was helpful and picturesque. Next to City palace and Hawa Mahal. Especially for those interested in astrology and astronomy, these large constructions are fascinating! Not at all what I expected.  Could have spent a lot more than the hour we did just looking round. To get value it is important to have some knowledge or a GOOD guide to talk you through the workings of this wonderfully preserved site. very nice if it is your interest. amazing what they achieved in that era with designs. not too many people if you go early so amazing the whole place is!
the time calculation and the planetary positions is awesome! its a must do in JAIPUR! What an astounding place to visit. How did they manage to create such accurate devices so many years ago. You will have to visit to see what I mean. The scale of the place will amaze you. You have to wonder how, back in the early 18th century, someone was able to calculate angles etc and build such an amazing place. The largest sundial there is accurate to 2 seconds - you can see the shadow moving.

Jantar Mantar is quite compact... The Jantar Mantar or observatory was a highlight for me. It's one of the very few surviving in India. If you are interested in astronomy or even horoscopes you find this place very interesting. The scale and diversity of the structure is something to behold.... I wouldn't have believed this unless I had seen it. The Jantar Mantar was built in 1728 and contains architectural instruments used in astronomy. It is adjacent to the City Palace and Museum and has 14 instruments that include the world's largest sundial. Apparently there... This review is late. I visited Jantar Mantar (Jaipur) as part of the group tour I booked from Delhi. It is located at the heart of the city near the City Palace. This place is always packed with tourists and locals. We arrived at noon... Interesting science park, which has some very impressive astrological equipment.  Make sure you take a good guide in with you, so you get the history. Can be hot for an afternoon summer visit. Try going in the morning or late evening just before closing. Recommended only for those who have an interest in astronomy and the calculation of time and eclipses. 
we bought a 5 place visit pass that included... Very impressive to look at and interesting history, although not exactly the most exciting site. As you could imagine, there weren't excellent facilities. This is very nice place indeed a unique architecture. Niait this place if you are in jaipur , prefer to visit in evening or early morning as day time its too hot Well, the Jantar Mantar was not of much interest to me. It didn't find it much different from the one in Delhi. Thought the place is nice with the Ancient Architecture and design. It had various interesting design with can tell the time with the... This was surprisingly interesting. I knew I would enjoy this, but I didn't realize how much. The guide we had was wonderful, VERY knowledgeable. Definitely worth a visit, then you can say you have seen the worlds largest sun dial! many ancient genius instruments to observe stars and sun path.  quite impressive although the site was very small.

A basic knowledge of astronomy and physics probably helps to get the most out of the visit.
It's certainly unique! Allow about an hour. There wasn't much shade as you... Without guide bit difficult to understand. Our guide book  help us out in getting and understanding the structures... On first impression the site looks like a collection of structures placed throughout an open area but its not until taking a tour that you realize the grandeur of the design visible at Jantar Mantar.

While we used the audio guide I would suggest possibly... Had no idea the world's largest sundial was in Jaipur nor that it had such an enormous observatory - one of five built across Northern India.  Take a guide.  The visit has me putting the Delhi observatory on my list of places to see. Good commentary from the guide but I enjoyed relaxing in the grounds as much as the tour itself as it was a hot day. get the audio guide as it attempts to explain the instruments to you.. much better than a guide who just points and tells you where you can take photos.. this one is like a puzzle. i like it. interesting place. this is situated in center of city near by city palace. at this place we need guide. without guide  we can't understand anything about this.  at this place see time management and zodiac signs.... I guess this the second thing Jaipur has better than Delhi, beside Shesh Mahal. Clean, the audio guide was helpful and picturesque. Next to City palace and Hawa Mahal. This place proves the rich education system and the kind of knowledge we had in our country, Its a MUST place to visit. Jaipur, is a place where all the Rajput's ruled and its about the richness of wealth and courage. Please visit this city... So poorly maintained, with the sun dial a bit ok, but needs some updating to give time. The guide just knew few answers, mainly for children, as he could not answer two simple questions a guy asked in our group.   Very overrated. I did not expect to love this but was astounded at the devices that look more like modern art sculptures than tools for measuring all types of astronomical things. It was bright and sunny so we were able to see them working. Very interesting. The place where maths is very important, architecture is so good and people who made this place were simply genius. You can check time, years, horoscope everything is here man. The largest and best observatory in the world. Very accurate and amazing instruments built. Alongwith amber and nahargarh forts, a must see for visitors. The scale of these astronomical instruments is just amazing: there's a sundial there as big as a 4-story building! Worth a visit when in Jaipur. Awesome calculations done by the oldies.
Get a guide and explore this place. You will be stunned how accurate things are. Get a mobile phone and search for it on the net while the guide explains and you will be stunned,
A must visit for... Must for people interested in learning science in ancient time. Well maintained and having a guide is a must. Hour and half is more than enough to visit this place. Makes us think how at ancient age so much advancement was there in science and astrology. Most instruments are functioning still now and its so lovely to see and experience the place As it is near the city palace, it is easy to do a quick tour.  The astronomical instruments are rather impressive. I had watched a documentary about this attraction, and was really looking forward to actually visiting the site.

We were shown around by a historian/astrologist .. I feel you need that, to... Weird and wonderful when you consider how accurate these instruments still are. A maharaja built this modelled on the one he built in New Delhi for the moghul emperor and 3 other ones in the early 1700s.

He assembled the world's best minds    and hid... The remains of the observatory Jantar Mantar is a tribute to the Indian technical soul. Take a guide to explain the usefulness of the features you will find there is amazing. Very interesting and amazing how well done it is, fun to see all the star signs and how they used to view them without modern technology. Beautiful architecture and included in composite ticket you can buy at the bmeredith palace. To stand among the artifacts of old and admiring the applied knowledge of the ancient scientists in their study of the skies and stars is just amazing.  It is like an ancient science museum.

Although hiring a guide is important for understanding the marvellous equipments and placement of these instruments. Yes, Jaipur was a great astrological centre. Kings supported scholastic experiments. They created architectural beauty around the experiments and allowed the common people to learn about the science involved.
Making it a tourist place and opening it for wandering onlookers at a fees is mere... Looks like a modern art sculpture park - only of course these are old astrological instruments.

Good visit for people who believe in time, astronomy and universal change.

Get the combined ticket and take in some of the other sights in and around Jaipur. Interesting and very different site in the Centre of the Pink City.  We has a guide which brought the place alive but even on your own it is week worth a visit. Had heard a lot about this place to decided a pay a visit.

I had never heard of this place before going there. My friends and I decided to go because we happened to have some time to spare after visiting the Jaipur City Palace. I found the observatory to be an interesting and unusual attraction in the... Nothing to knock you off your feet, but better maintained than the three forts. Some nice photo spots though. One of several observatories built around northern India by Sawai Jai Singh in the early 18th C.

I found this to be the most interesting sight in Jaipur - definitely worth the time to visit and gain an understanding. The site had multiple ancient date/ time predicting exhibits with repeated design, but nothing unique Wow, what a place. So interesting and amazing how advanced it is even for today. A guide is necessary (very inexpensive) for it all to make sense, kids may be bored but adults will enjoy It's not often that you get into the thinking of previous generations, but Jantar Mantar gives you the opportunity to explore the relationship between Astronomy and Astrology in Hindu life One simply wonders how the people of ancient era were ahead of their time in terms of intelligence and development of their own technology. Not the size of jantar mantar at new delhi - but compact, guides are helpful and one does learn a lot of things there- you may even set your chronograph by the sun dial and actually find it giving time which is close to that... Fine structures that were built centuries ago. Can be proud of our ancestors knowledge in mathematics, trigonometry and astronomy. But for an average guy with little knowledge in the above fields.... couldn't understand the concept. Located at the heart of the pink city, this is an absolute must visit. It is close to the City Palace and Hawa Mahal and all can be clubbed together. It also offers the sprawling ambiance of a park and if one is too tired... It is an astronomical treasure house with solar devices that give you accurate predictions to date. During our visit, I think, we missed out Hawa Mahal, the Palace of Winds, therefore I shall get back to Jaipur again - sometimes an itinerary get some leaks... The place is hidden between shops. the view of this place looks like a play ground for kids. But the guide explained about the place in detail and then we came to know its importance. It worked with movement of sun. All things were calculated... While not overly interested in what this place had to offer Jantar Mantar is quite cool. The vibe is almost like gardens and walking around the monument and sculptures is nice. The composite ticket is something worth getting as it gets you into 4 other... Interesting history, but must take a guide to understand all the monuments. Otherwise can just look like a lot of structures. 
Is a place for people who enjoy history and interesting concepts. The history of this place is fascinating.......how an amazing ruler with a particular interest in mathematics, managed to construct the largest sun dial in the world ( in two parts) with an accuracy of 2 seconds!!!  Plus there are huge stone shapes all aligned with... To be honest, I have developed interest in Studying Astronomy & Jyotish after seeing this wonderful place.. Must watch.. History behind Hindu religion and ancient knowledge of Astronomy intertwined and sponsored by Rulers of Jaipur  shows Rich heritage of Rajasthan During my visit to Jaipur one of the most exciting things I saw was the observatory.  There were dozens of structures that could determine the exact time of day, month, and year, and place in the Zodiac.  All of this because of the point where... Amazing concept of watching time here. Hired a guide @ Rs. 200. you can clicks photos also. Do eat local kulfi outside. Its amazing! Also do try chana zor garam also It was very interesting to see all this accurated measure instruments of the antiquity and how it was difficult to know the exactly time, month, seasons and the constellations and even the zodiacal signs, by watching the sky. THEY have just started a light & sound show in the evening very very interesting , but take a warm jumper of jacket its gets cold sitting there for 2 hours but well worth it My son and I loved this place, in fact we spent 2 hours there looking at how it all works.  The observatory is very well kept and well explained, a must for any of you interested in this kind of stuff, very educational. Jantar Mantar is a collection of giant astronomical structures built to read the current time, star signs and the position of the sun, it also houses the worlds largest sundial. Get a guide they are very knowledgable and will teach you how to read the... As mentioned by other reviewers, if you are going to visit one of these places (another is right across from the Park Hotel in New Delhi, and there are others), this is the one to see. It has been radically and perhaps not exactly authentically... The guide, who was very friendly, taught us how to read time using the huge sundials present there. The structures present in jantar mantar are enough to evoke curiousity for science for any child for hs entire life The Jantar Mandar is few minutes away from the City Palace.
Have good look around, You get to see the instruments that were used to calculate the time, observations in the stars. Wonderful sight to see that some of the instruments still do work!

Worth... This medieval observatory is well maintained, but a lot of it is restored and not the original stuff. It is part of a set of five such observatories built but the one here in Jaipur is the largest one. The Jantar Mantar is located within... its so interesting to see and understand...the intelligence and practicality of yester years. 
Do get a guide..or else it will not be possible to understand the functionality of the place.
whether or not ur interested in science.....this place will amaze you!! I actually enjoyed the Observatory more than the Amber Palace. Perhaps I was “palaced out”, or perhaps I was enthralled by the smartness of the Guys who built this place.  Timex and Omega and TAG could well learn a thing or two about how to... You won't even understand even half of the structures(instruments) there. But even few you do understand will keep you amazed I wish I went here when I was still at school, would have leant my lessons on instruments of measure better :)... Do take your kids to this place and more importantly, understand and explain how the various instruments work. If you don't know then... It is one of the biggest Jantar Mantar with many astronomical instruments. Although detailed information is mentioned besides each instrument, getting a guide would be really helpful if you really need to understand what is what. Kids would surely enjoy the visit. The place where technology and royalty blends together......... Feels great if you understand the working principle of the instruments... Our guide from RSRTC was awesome .....A guide with technical as well as historical knowledge is recommended I have never had much interest in astrology or sun dials, but this is a fascinating place to visit. Loved it, and very well looked after. We had a guide and I would recommend that, as there is a lot of amazing information. Step out of the Jaipur city palace and see the observatory. First impression is Aw!! whats the big deal. Get a guide to explain it to you and feel the amazement. Its a fully functional observatory and you can even set the time on your... The place is well kept.  Wish they had more detailed descriptions of the instruments in the observatory. must visit with kids but only with the sun at the top 
during afternoon,... as everything is based on sun... The Jantar Mantar is 5 minutes walk from the City Palace. My husband discovered it first from the guide book, and was very excited about seeing it. How wrong I was to question his enthusiasm. This place is a must see, and the fact it... Crazy awesome!  A blend of science in the park and it's no wonder this place is super crowded.  It's lovely when the passions of historical figures are so elegantly captured and preserved.  Inspiring. This place is an architectural marvel and homage to science and all the scientists of ancient India. There was a giant sundial which was very interesting, made out of hard brackish material. The place demonstrates and presents science at its best. It was crowded and... Go there with a ittle time with a guide, and you will be awed. The sundials and mind blowing and you can actually see the time using a 90 foot structure. What gets better it consists of fourteen major geometric devices for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking stars' location as the earth orbits around the sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets at that time,
a jaw breaking place where you can find the ultimate blend of science and history,... Don't understand astronomy so everything sounded Greek and Latin. Pretty sure - 95% of the crowd swum in my sea too :P Its in heart of the city and can be given a visit. The landscape is nice it is well maintained. Did not take a guide. prefer audio guide There are too many positive adjectives to describe this .... we wonder when we went the weather was not the best so have not found a single line to get to see it ... it's really worth going there is beautiful. i visited with my friend.very nice place.full green and cleanses.and very knowledgeable place.history show Indian vastu ,all instrument is well maintain,and sun clock is very nice.i love this place. I found this observatory fascinating. So did Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh (1688-1744) – so much, in fact, that he built a new capital at Jaipur so that he could construct it. The astronomy is medieval, and makes no distinction between astronomy and astrology, yet the... At first sight it is difficult to see why anybody needed a 30 metre tall sundial but this place is worth spending a half hour because of its wierdness - even though it is overpriced by Indian standards. It was certainly more rewarding than the... Of great historic interest this and the other jantar mantras built in India. Made a sightseeing change from forts, palaces, and mosques...... must visit place for art, science and history lovers. very well maintained place; nice and clean. guide is must, which would cost you close to Rs. 200 ($ 4). City Palace was also just across it. You can do both in 3 - 4 hrs.... A fascinating place for people who are into Astrology, etc. But, would be very boring for people who don't understand such things like me! I went there for 20 mins and left. Maybe it would have been better with a guide or an audio guide,... The observatory consists of 14 major geometric devices for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking stars' location as the earth orbits around the sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets, and determining the celestial altitudes and related ephemerides.  Jantar Mantar (instrument formula) is one of the best... Worth a visit to see some pretty old large scale equipment still working. Our tour guide however did not do a great job od explaining. There are several of these astronomical observatories to visit in North India, and the one in Jaipur is almost certainly the most interesting. It has been very well restored and is in a very pleasant park. We had an excellent guide who explained how the... Good place to learn some of our old mathematics and other calculation measures like how time was being measured in old times, sun sign calculation etc. All the measurement were based upon sun light. It also reflects how precision were our ancestors. I really liked... Visited for 3rd time - quite interesting but very crowded you need to visit early morning. Disliked crowds but if you go early it is nice and peaceful it is a science based historical landmark but it is not understandable really if you don't read everything about it before. if you like astrology, learn how these devices work before going there. This is a good place for those who are interesred in astrology and stars , for a person like me it was ok ok. Pleaee take a guide or you will not be able to understand anything as all the machines are made up of... Jantar Mantar certainly makes you appreciate how advanced some humans were centuries ago. The astronomical instruments are incredible and when you consider they were constructed in the mid 1700s it certainly makes you think. 

When visiting Jantar Mantar you are away from the hustle and... An amazing collection of outdoor astronomical instruments constructed in the early 18th century to improve the accuracy of measurements and observations of the planets. Unfortunately, this was in the cause of improving the precision of horoscopes rather than astronomy itself. The instruments are well-preserved/restored and... We feel proud to know about the wisdom of our ancestors.I was pleasantly surprised to know that it has been declared a world heritage site. The place is nicely maintained. I always like to spend sometime in this surrealistic place.
in India astrology is the base of any decision taken in the life.
at birth ,the horoscope is calculated and even the names are choosen according with the positions of the stars of the newborn.... How amazing it is, centuries ago a Jaipur King could create something as great as this. He understand the knowledge that was so advanced in his time. It was totally amazaing how a 15 year old can come up with an idea of Jantar Mantar. This is the only place where we were not pestered by Tour Guides or people selling stuff. It was very quiet and lovely to just walk around... I can understand why Jantar Mantar gets mixed reviews from visitors. I would recommend a visit to this place just to marvel at the scale at which the Maharaja encouraged and patronized astronomy (It could have been astrology that the raja was more interested in,... Although of great historic interest and very clever we found it was not for us
Unless you are into Astrology, etc. you may find it boring. If that is the case give it a miss Just imagine what they knew all those years ago and thanks to the Jaipur Royal family who took keen interest in Astronomy and the fabulous sundials that keep time to 2 seconds absolute. Very well kept, clean, take a guide to know about this better... In the age of technology everthing is available on the internet. I mean anything. But think of the eighteenth century when even watches were rare. In those times the science of astronomy could have been so advanced is not just amazing but mind blowing. To... JM is a significant monument of the history of astronomy.still well maintained and very clean.one of the best historical monument to visit in jaipur ,i really enjoyed being here. entered from the crowds outside, suddenly to a clean, neat and beautiful compus with trees and lawn--like a surprise. not much understand those astronomical instruments, but it's a nice place to visit and imagine the old days when people ddin't have much tools to measure... Frankly speaking it's a part of our itinerary, we have not enjoy that it was just a visit. It's not that attractive. It was quite fascinating to know how people in ancient times calculated time and found out the position of sun . There are astronomical  instruments that predicted eclipses and tracked location of the stars. You will find very learned guides who will tell you exactly... Huge astronomical instruments of 18th century are well preserved. This site is near the city palace and a great symbol of scientific and political authority possessed by Jai Singh II. Please do visit with a guide. We enjoyed our visit and took pictures posing in... The best of five Jantar Mantar sites in India. The beautiful white instruments are in amazing condition. We spent just under an hour there walking around before heading to the nearby Hawa Mahal and City Palace Museum. This place is very interesting b/c of the astronomical history.  It has the largest Sundial in the world.   It is quite fascinating to see and contemplate the design and how it all works.  An astronomer or mathematician would be in heaven here. Our guide MADE this for us. His knowledge of the history was 100%, but the way he was able to describe and explain the science made it very special. Unbelievable way to enjoy a hobby, even for a king! this lovely park of strange objects used to plot time and space is extraordinary worth a visit but confusing It looks like a neglected sculpture park (or maybe skate park?), but it's a collection of huge astronomical instruments. We did as the guidebook recommended, and hired one of the guides to explain everything to us  - and that was good advice. There is not... This place is fascinating. It's our second visit to Jantar Mantar andwe learned new information via the audio guide. Visit this site in conjunction with Hawa Mahal which is just around the corner. Interesting sideshow to the Indian experience. 200 rupees (£2) entry, well worth it. A variety of constructions of mathematical, astronomical and astrological design, weird and wonderful, in its way. Within the Pink City walls, off the main street, this is a fun place to check... Nice place to understand the concept of solar system..how to calculate time etc...its a must visit for family or solo as it makes you realise that even in older times people were brilliant in tracking time... Take a guide who  can explain the different things , its nice to see but you need an explanation to understad everything ,exept your a astronômist...
You can drink there a little thing in the corner
Than visit city palace,just 100 metres further. Worth a trip. Interest at Jantar mantar will depend on whether you are an astronomical student or not. Entire area has ancient mathematical and astronomical instruments at display. world heritage site Five of these observatories were built by the same king, Sawai Jai Singh II.  This is the best preserved and gives insight into the sophisticated knowledge of the ancients regarding our planets, the sun, the moon...and their effects on the earth.  Some of these giant... The main reason we wanted to visit was because we KNEW our 10 year old loves this kind of stuff.  He's a little engineer.  I ended up loving this centuries old astronomical observatory.  It is extraordinary that all those years ago the Indians had such... Not must visit site, we went there when our train was later. A good tip would be to hire a guide which is quite cheap in india else if very difficult to find out what exactly these structures are and what is their significance. The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is a three century old astronomical observatory. I used a live guide but his English wasn't that clear. If I had more time I think that the audio tour would have been more informative. I really wanted to understand how... These are remarkable structures considering how old they are. They're also impressively accurate, and to appreciate that a guide is necessitated, otherwise it would just be a whole bunch of strange looking things in a walled courtyard. I think it might not be so great... This place is not only interesting architecturally but is awe inspiring as well.  The technology, albeit ancient, is very sophisticated.  Definitely recommend seeing this, even if it is for a short time. Located in a park near the City Palace Jantar Mantar features arcane astronomical stone instruments of varying size and also some for the ""signs""; it is worthwhile to have a guide who can explain the use of each instrument. Looking at what appears to be an unfinished block structure with stairs that are roped off, even with the scientific and historical info is boring, unless there is a demonstration or protest happening. It was a fantastic place to visit!!! It would have been very hard to understand about it without guide! Luckily we had one from ""India's invitation"" who was awesome! Also visit jantar mantar .the jartar mantar a collection of architectural astronomical instruments ,built by maharaja Jantar Muntar! if you like science then its a must see.. you dont need a guide.. get an audio tape.. but it is a little patronising and there is a rubbish story of a grandfather and grandchild.. also when you leave do not take pictures... Amazing to think what these people knew, and calculated accurately so long ago. Particularly liked the ""star-sign"" section, still relevant today. Be sure NOT to miss this place This observatory is a World Heritage Site, probably based on its uniqueness. We had never seen anything like it before. Who would expected a Rajput maharaja with such a love of astronomy that he built a whole garden of bizarre and unusual astronomical measurement devices?... I loved this museum - small and easy to walk around in a relatively short time (we took an hour) it contains some beautiful astronomical instruments and structures from the 12th century. The sheer size and scale of some of these is really impressive and... What a fascinating place.  All the mathematics and astronomy were quite over my head but so interesting that India had such a detailed knowledge of the stars and universe.  Well worth a visit. I've never come across anything quite like the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur. I strongly recommend the audio tour or you will be totally lost. The signs do not tell you enough to fully understand what you are looking at. If you buy a multi visitor pass at the fort this avoids the crowds waiting at the entrance and its cheaper. If you are into the development of early mathematics, astronomy or generally cool things built long ago - this is a really interesting visit. 
Out of everything we've seen in Jaipur, Delhi and Agra - this is the only place I would say you definitely... Worth a look. Depending on how interested you are in all things astrological - if not too interested a good look around would take only about 30 mins - but if these things fascinate you I'm sure it would take longer.
This was one place... Nice place... U can visit  within 30 mins...  Its natural time & other calculation for sun sign... worlds biggest watch... Jantar Mantar                                                                  Jaipur city is seems to small but had great historical value                                                                            one must visit this place if it wasn't for the scientific value and the marvel of how these enormous contraptions kept time I don't think anyone would give this place a second look. It had the look of an oversized skating park The whole idea of sharing a review is to make people aware of the awesome potential of a place ...
Jantar Mantar is 1 such underrated place whose potentials need to be spread. as we know with the name itself signifies technology, but to believe... This was built by jai singh , a true king . he was such an inteligent man , the instrument built at that time still work correctly . i reccomend a guide in every historical place in rajasthan but at jantar mantar you had to... hard to believe that so long ago someone did such a rhing and still working perfectly precise till today. Incredible Rajastan, inceredible India. Must to see. I found this quite mind blowing, as there are different instruments to read everything from the time, to your horoscope and even co-ordinates - a 200 year old GPS!  Definitely worth the visit. A very unusual place. Come to see the large instruments built to measure the stars and planets. Be warned that you will be out in the sun without any shade. Plan on 1 - 2 hours for a visit. These huge structures are really an observatory.  It is fascinating.  If you get the chance read up about the instruments before you go. Use a guide or an audio guide as you could miss out on the history and workings of this astonishing place. It's still possible to get an accurate time check here from 'pieces of rock' amazing and very clever This astrological scientific site is a fascinating mixture of highly developed scientific/engineering development at least partially in the cause of a strong and continuing belief in the power of astrology. we were thinking that Jantar Mantar would be very good, but we are quite disappointed .. there is nothing to see more.. you can see  from outside. I got mesmerised at the far sightness of the Maharaja of Jaipur to conceive the place and then undertaking the engineering and construction. A Master piece by any angle - architecture, art, engineering, history and accuracy. Still works today. Mind boggling of Indian ancestory .... We took a guided tour and it was extremely informative. Our children aged 4 and 8 enjoyed it. Jantar Mantar houses the largest and most accurate  sundials in the world. It was amazing to see! Went to Jantar Mantar as part of the Tour I was on.

All the instrumentation and the thought behind it was mind-bottling!

It's quite big so for the more interested in Adtronomy you could spend some time here. 

I would recommend a guide as he... This is one of the mothers of sundial.  It's is very interesting and factual. I'm a man of science myself and this is just an awesome attraction to be preserved. Just thinking about the brains behind it. Really really glad to be here. Buy the multi site seeing ticket of Rs 70 per person as buying individual tickets will be costly. Jantar Mantar is an historical place where once can see how good & calculative our scientist were to calculate the position of the sun & planets when... Jantar mantar is not historically but astronomically crucial as well  . The cognizance of  instruments and their concepts is quite arousing. Two advice one you should visit it on a sunny day , second a guide is must . It takes approx 1 hr  .A... Don't think of doing this without a guide otherwise you'll miss out on all the details.  I was absolutely fascinated by this and recommend it. Very scientific, one has to see it to believe the accuracy of these 18th century instruments. But please ensure that you visit with a guide, else it will be a wasted trip This attraction is good for about 30 minutes, but they will be a fun 30 minutes.  There are several ingenious scientific creations that provide for intricate timekeeping.  In addition, there are some structures designed to track the planets for astrological purposes.  Whether or not one... I was so intrigued by this place. I had no idea what to expect and I was very suprised. The instruments in this park are amazingly precise! It is a perfect place to go with kids, and to explain to them everthing about the movement... While the abhaneri step well shows the genius of the people at that time, jantar mantar shows the science prowess. The science of pin pointing any extra celestial object in the universe by stone structures One can update knowledge about planets and how we can use it. Every good architecture, just can not belive it. Guide is very much needed to get information, otherwise its difficult to understand things. Amazing  knowledge of the past and the technical correctness of the different instruments, absolutly take a guide to understand the fascination! This little spot needs a guide to explain how the ""instruments"", more like scuptures, work.  Good photo opportunity, needs only about 45 minutes to view.  Good for kids. Didn't expect to find an observatory in the centre of Jaipur, but then India can be very unpredictable. If astrology is your thing this will interest you with it's sun dials and other instruments. One of the best places from Jaipur. Amazing how everything was created that allowed to read time and get more knowledge about the universe with great accuracy. It is a fantastic place for an afternoon and you can learn quite a lot. This venue is jam packed with beautiful structures that also serve a real purpose. It is amazing to think these enormous sundials and other astronomical tools are more accurate than some watches. The only thing it lacks is some fortune telling (although I am sure... The place was knowledge house of the earliest scientific discoveries. You need a proper and well versed guide to enjoy the place and understand the workings of the ancient structures Visited this place last month. Looks impressive but make sure you read about jantar mantar before visiting this place otherwise you wont understand the true value of instruments inside jantar manter. Really Impressed with architectural astronomical instruments built long back but could  measure time and... The structures were so complicated with one structure per zodiac sign. They are able to tell the exact date and time down to the exact minute. It's amazing how they were able to calculate all these thousands of years ago.

Make sure someone explains to... Quite impressive. With technical background you will understand that (a) many instruments are superfluous: how many ways to do you need to measure the location of something? (b) accuracy was achieved by ratios of large distances, and (c) why are there no telescopes? Galileo was... we don't have much time and we need to travel back to delhi...we really wanted to go and see the jantar mantar but since we only have very limited time we missed it...we suggest to plan your itinerary very well...jaipur was a nice place to... We impromptu decided to go for the light and sound show at Jantar Mantar - it was the last show, and the two of us ended being the only audience! While the show was very well done, we feel the script is not well balanced.... I had heard a lot of about this place before visiting. And I felt that the entry ticket and the fees we paid to the guide was worth every penny. Good part is, they have a standard set for tourist guides. Guides are available in... An interesting complex across from the City Palace. Initially it looks like a childs' playground but is an observatory.  Such sophistication  in 1700s. Great SIte but beware of the guides. Guides rule Jaipur...everything you buy has a commission element to it...therefore try as much as possible to go shopping without the guide and get 50% reduction in pricing We were a group of 8, two of which were children under the age of 7. Not the best attraction for very young children, but we decided to go all together anyway. 

There is such incredible history in India, and this place was truly fascinating.... This collection of astronomical instruments, built around 1730, was fascinating! Located in a beautiful park-like setting, this observatory has more that 10 geometric devices for probing the heavens: measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking stars and astrological signs. VERY interesting! This is a Bonanza for  Physics and Astronomy students of the World. To make it easy, the entry tickets have been priced as Rs.40/- for 15 students, to visit this place. This may not be very interesting  for common people as it requires certain level... Well this place was a disapointment. Its in the middle of pink city so you can easily stop by and see it, but I didn't get into it to much. This is a great place to see some history and science in India. The giant sundial is impressive and the other instruments are really interesting as well. Although we went with a guide, there are signs in English, which explain the history of the different... This is a World Heritage Monument as per Unesco 2010. This is the largest and best preserved of Maharaja of Jaipur Sawai Jai Singh's five observatories. It is built in stone and marble whose settings and shapes are designed scientifically and which are one of... Brilliant breakthrough...!!!
It still accurate until now even though they invent it in past.
Really a great human invention and a nice piece of human work. The guide we had was someone with deep knowledge of its attributes.
Try and get a well versed guide, otherwise you won't know how important Astronomy was in ancient times. Such a great mind!!! Great yantra's has been build here to measure time - when watches didn't existed.. Yantra's to know about the movement of planet and stars - when no have been to space...and many more yantra's which i was not able to understand.... A very relaxing place to visit either as a wander round on your own (there are signs in English and Hindi) or with a very helpful guide for only 200/300R. My husband was interested in the scientific nature of these instruments and I was impressed... Very impressive observatory, but if you don't get a guide to explain to you how these devices work, it's a bit pointless to go there. As soon as you get i, there will be many guides offering their services for around 200 INR. These abstract... It's very impressive to see a more than 30 meter high sundial that messure the time in seconds!
Almost unbelievable that all these instruments are so correct in messurering. There are all kinds of yantras of old to measure time, space and the movement of stars and planets. It takes some knowledge of geometry to truly understand the designs of the tools that are out there. But once you do, you can't but be... This is one of the 5 Jantar Mantars in the country. We went on the day tour arranged by RSTDC which gave us very little time to see through the entire place. Whatever little we saw was impressive. Spend atleast an hour to glance through... It may have been our tour guide who made the experience feel like a school trip including telling those talking at the back of the class off. (Raj - Hayes and Jarvis). We could hardly stand up and wanted to leave. So all in all,... This was very interesting, but a bit beyond my mathematical understanding.  If you don't want your brain to get tired following all of the detailed descriptions, just go along and be impressed with the intricacies of the science behind all of this.  Would recommend a... You really have to see this place to believe it.  At first sight it looks like staircases in the middle of a park - or a modern art sculpture garden.  But no, this is an observatory built in 1728 and the calculations you get from... I had no idea, before visiting, of the prodigious talent which produced such a display of early astronomy which is still so cogent at the present time.  Very interesting, if fleeting, visit...definitely needed to buy guidebook to aid memory and explain... it is very surprising but we have to engage a guide to know about the construction it is very surprising one
by
jagannathan We had no idea what we were going to see so it was a huge surprise. What an amazing park. So worth he time as it is very unique and interesting. it is so very precise, the guide actually showed us how to calculate time to the second from a 90 FOOT tall structure. Unbelievable. Go there and definitely take a guide with you. this place is rt in the center of city.it closes at 4:30 pm, and close to city palace--the main  attraction. again taking guide is recommended if you want to understand this thing. Being in such a place make it weird when you feel that people more than a 200 years ago was already studying the stars and even thought they didn't have any of our modern technology they were able to give a good and precise accounts... We didn't want to go since it was very hot but we went through with it anyway.  This place is amazing...I didn't realize that they were already so skillful and knowledgeable in the skies and astronomy...worth your time, but try to go there early morning... Great visit, do take a guide with you to explain the exhibits. Thoroughly recommend the exhibits. Hopefully visit in a sunny day to be able to see the display in action. We visited this place this october last. The weather was cozy. I would suggest to visit twice. Grab the place a close look in the day time view and in the evening you may enjoy the sound and light show which explain every details of... Ticket included in the main ticket to the palace.  Some instruments such as huge sun dial not fully functional. No access to astronomical observation ramps. Worth a half hour or so.

It is a series of huge instruments and geometric devices for telling the time, calculating the movements of planets, and calculating horoscopes.  It... This was a really interesting site. Fascinating explanations of how they measured time and distances in the solar system. Site was partially under repair at the time so we were unable to see the area where the astrological signs were. A man years ahead of his time, a king with a vision and the treasury to fulfill his dreams of astronomy on a grand scale.

Is next... Lovely place , the kids enjoyed the visit as they could understand how in old days the time,position of the sun, lattitude, longitude where calculated.very nice and interesting.

This is a place to be worth seeing in Jaipur. The place is worth seeing only if you take a human guide to understand the beauty and the information associated with this place.

You will need a good guide to extract information as the information are poorly documented. We had visited Jantar mantar when on a holiday at Jaipur. Its a fantastic piece of Art, Science and imagination. Really admired the science that the ancient kings like Raja Jaisingh had.

It's a wonderful collection of astronomical and astrological instruments, built by Sawai Jai Singh, a Rajput king under Emperor Aurangzeb around 1730. 

It boasts the largest sundial in the world and although it may have been fantasy... I agree with others that this one in Jaipur is the best  in all of India, and all that I have ever seen.  Our guide was very helpful since there needs a little more explanation than what is written and it's more understandable to view... I went late in the afternoon and didn't really have much time, my advice would be get a guide so that you fully understand the history of this place. This is the best solar observatory (and still accurate!) in India. Go on a sunny day and see the instruments in action. Have a guide explain what each one does. Amazing! The worlds largest sundial and more. This is superb if you get a guide from the attraction. We were very lucky as our Sita guide knew one of the best guides to get. The place is awesome if explained but some visitors were clearly not...

Thanks to Jantar Mantar..

The observatory was a bit of a surprise to me - it was fascinating and perhaps made a bit of a change from forts and palaces. Science and history completely intertwined. Don't miss. This Jantar Mantar is probably the best around in India. Its accuracy is so good that even today after so many years the instruments work fine. I am amazed that certain kings were able to think in terms of mathematics and physics apart from being... This place is amazing considering when it was built and how accurate it is. It's a good idea to pay for a guide here as if I didn't I definitely wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.

Various astonomical instruments have been erected here. One must really appreciate the efforts by the kings for establishing such scientific instruments in the good old days.  Better take a guide or read some literature about this place before you venture inside Hire a guide to know the details of the place. It is just mind boggling to see how precisely it is built on such a big scale.
Those guys had enormous knowledge about movements of sun and other stars.
If you have kids with you,... Jantar Mantar is fabulous place to visit. You just can't believe that astronomy and astrology was so developed in 1600's! The instruments present over there are grand and precise. A good guide can explain everything very precisely, which is astonishing. It is a must visit...

The elder two enjoyed it, it went over the heads of the younger two and it was the last thing we saw after sight seeing all day....

You will be marvelled by how each of the gigantic and small instruments have been modelled to predict the time, path of planets, zodiac signs, Distance of a star, Latitude and longitude, Dates of eclipses.. I can go on.

But none of this will make... Jantar mantar is an unbelievable example of command over science of Indian people.Just by infrastructure, the exact calculation of time, stars to the fractions of second is just amazing.
Perhaps even today in the time of satellites the perfection can be compared with it. I love the Jantar Mantar in Delhi but the one in Jaipur is well worth a visit.  Very interesting place to see and am amazed at how accurate it all is.  Great to see all the star signs and position of the moon etc. and... Jantar Mantar has been the center of attraction around city palace area with Astrophysical wonders all around the compound.

I was simply amazed to see all that I've been hearing/reading since a long time.
Yes, our ancestors were genius! This place is an engineering marvel. 
A MUST visit for a person with scientific mind. The sun dials are magnificient; and I should have spent more time with audio guide or understand ancient astronomy before I revisit this place. We were convinced by our guide to see this 400 year old scientific observatory, and were pleased we did. Amazing how accurate the varied sundials are, and the whole place was fascinating. Need a good guide to explain the structures or it is difficult to... proud to be an Indian....see the advanced science way back in 1728..... must take a guide along and enjoy. The place is well preserved and neat. Thanks to the authorities for that. built by Sawai Jai Singh who was a Rajput king. It is one of the four Jantar Mantar which are in Mathura, Delhi and Ujjain. Consists of world's largest sundial. It is a world heritage site. Go when the sun is shining so you can see the sun dials working....We didn't and regretted not returning
You need a guide, they really explain everything, and the sundials are pretty complex so you're unlikely to work it all out yourself.
A fabulous structure,... A fascinating scientific achievement and totally unexpected. Clearly demonstrates that scientific advancement was not limited to the west. If you have noone to explain anything to you, you will find this to be a very average place as it is impossible to understand. But if the guide or the audio aids given are able to explain the process of measuring time etc using... The history of this place is fantastic - Take the audio guide to understand what all of the instruments are about.

This place is a key part of the global history of scientific endevour - so it has to be worth a visit

I also... We're geeks and this place was incredible - huge astronomical instuments for measuring the stars, well kept and well preserved. Right in the centre of town too This was included the highlights of Jaipur all the miscellaneous guide books I had read about India.  So, I included in my itinerary, despite not particularly caring much about astronomy. Consequently, I wasn't that impressed.  The pictures here do give a good overview of what... When in Jaipur it's worth a visit to the Jantar Mantar. It's in close proximity to the other attraction centers like the Hawa Mahal. Upkeep of this astronomical observatory is very much needed. Its very difficult to understand and herin the Guides comes ito the... Jantar mantar is all about space and planets. This is a old observatory developed by Jai Singh. But it is difficult to understand how it works. There is no telescope or instruments. For example, time of the day can be known from the shadow on... Jantar Mantar though has Unesco seal, its a very simple  monumento. More for those interested in astronomy. For tourist its only a valued monument showing how science was so devellopped some centuries ago. Simple tourist will find it difficult to understand the instruments presented there. We didn't know anything about this place until our tour guide took us here. We would highly recommend a tour guide so you know what you are looking at. At first we thought it would be boring, but once you learned about how everything works... Certain attractions are intriguing. we hired a guide as we thought that would benefit our kids. I would recommend you do some reading prior to visiting so that you can complete the attractions in 30 minutes by yourself. There is a small coffee shop with... After visiting Jantar Mantar, I was really proud of myself and my ancestors who have contributed much to the science, the world and well documented the knowledge they have earned and learned. 

I hardly understands the astronomy, which helps in astrology, but it was good... the place is full of those amazing things which will make you think that what kind of technology we had in past and how our astronomers have made these so called gadgets to detect time like calculations, a must visit place You will need a guide to truly understand the instruments and the intelligence behind them. Quite a surprise and well worth the visit I was awestruck by the technology we Indians had to calculate the exact time, date, latitude, longitude..... and many other things here..... This is definitely a place to visit for people who love science and inventions....... Go there on a sunny mid day, so that... Take a Guide otherwise it will be difficult to fully understand the place. 
Its really unbelievable that such instruments were made at such a time where there were no computers or any modern equipment. Jantar Mantar is the largest stone observatory in the world.  It was one of five built in the 1700’s by Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh, who founded Jaipur. Sawai Jai Singh was a man of science and wanted as accurate readings of the positions of planets,... It's a collection of old sun dials and horoscope tools. Impressive in its scale and time-telling accuracy.

If you have nothing else to do, this can quickly fill the time. After about 15 minutes, you've basically seen all of the instruments and can go on... Thats very  different to everything else you see everywhere, temples, forts, palaces. Very interesting what people hundreds of years ago knew about stars, planets,...
Take a guide or audioguide so you got the explanations to all the ""buildings"". But don't go there, if you're not... This place is a must see place for those who love astronomy. How accurately Maharaj Jai singh had made this is really worth mentioning. In a single shot , you are able to predict the time, season, zodiac sign all measured to 2 sec accuracy.... Boy were these guys ahead of their time, all the instruments and nic naks were fascinating considering how old they are, it was an interesting place to visit and listen to the explanation for all the astronomy readings and how they are calculated. We chose to do this attraction without a guide, but if your brain is scientifically inclined and you understand astronomy then it would be nice to hire a guide. They're not that expensive, I think 250 rupees for 1-4 people.

The massive measuring instruments are... One must see the way this structures are put up those days to measure time. Make sure the sun is there for you to experience and see how it works. It was hot and not many eateries nearby but well maintained
Good place to visit with school age children Nice place to visit if going to Jaipur for the first time. Try to go early so it is less hot.

Children will enjoy the visit more. Just the fact that 15/16th Century technology was telling 21st century time, astronomical charts etc with such accuracy. it is a good place to visit once. it shows how people in older days used to know the time based on the sunlight. especially interesting for science buffs like me. This World Heritage listed, Jantar Mantar located in Jaipur, is the largest and best preserved, among the five such observatories built during the Mughal period of Indian history, by Sawai Jai Singh II of Amber, a very keen astronomer, between 1727 and 1734. These Jantar... This will take you about 30 minutes to an hour to cover.  Lots of old instruments about astrology.  I didn't get much of what it was about, but hey, it's old :) Well worth having a guide to show you around. Always use an official guide they are very informative. An escape from forts and palaces, into the world of scientific instruments writ large! An impressive set of (rebuilt) ways of measuring space and time.  Avoid the heat of the day, as there is little shade to spend the time needed. Although not many people visit it, this is one of the most conserved observatory of India, and it is very worthy to pay it a visit... I loved it! Amazing to think that so many years ago, understanding of astronomy was such that 'tools' could be built to tell the time to an accuracy of 20seconds for example.

Very interesting to see! Never seen anything like this, an array of all size of sundials, calculators and astrological timepieces on grand scale. All working as a law was enforced that no tall building could be built Around it that would prevent the sun rays falling on the time... My daughters and I really liked figuring out how the various astonomical/solar devices worked.  All the marks and designs are clearly visible, unlike the Jantar Mantar in Delhi.  Much nicer looking too. since my daughter had made a model of Jantar mantar in her school we made it  a point to see this beautiful and scientific observatory-its definitely worth a visit The Jantar Mantar is a collection of architectural astronomical instruments. It has been inscribed on the World Heritage List as ""an expression of the astronomical skills and cosmological concepts of the court of a scholarly prince at the end of the Mughal period"". The observatory... Here is not intresting thing for turist here will come only student for study and maping but peapul come here for turism 1st time and last time i go their three time but i dont know why This is the Indias largest observatory. Must see a place. This is close to City Palace, which shall not be missed also. The concept, the creation, the quest of knowledge of the then ruling kings..... But if you are interested in Astronomy only then visit this place. Absolutely cant understand anything. The guides are horrible..they tell you whatever....! You should really have a person with you who... India, said to be the birthplace of ""Zero"", and great Indian Mathematician ""Aryabhatta"". The Jantar Mantar justifies this. This is such a wonderous place; that such technology was available at that point of time. Words can't explain my thoughts. Just see it - you'll feel... Awe inspiring to know that  centuries ago there were scientists who were able to make accurate astronomical predictions.Largest sun dial. Very well maintained, a must see for all kids to appreciate the wealth of knowledge India lost claim to. This astronomical observation site built in the early 18th century features impressive structures that allow for the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The sprawling complex includes a set of approximately 20 gigantic fixed instruments, which are mostly in great condition Historically the... This observatory from about the 17th century ( by Jai Singh) is quite amazing. Unfortunately we did not have a tour guide, but you can get along on your own as well. Nevertheless, a tour guide would be to prefer to explain how the instruments... The observatory of Jai Singh II is a very original and amazing place to see. In India, you'll see a lot of temples, gaths and palaces but this visit is really exceptional. Even tough you're not a great specialist in sciences and astronomy, you'll learn... A history to be seen 
Enjoyed the time out there
A history that needs to be seen

There are some large sundials, one accurate to 20 seconds and the larger one accurate to 2 seconds! a must visit. get a guide who would explain about the jantar mantar at length and make it a more worthy experience. This amazing Observatory was built between 1720's and 1730's but looks so modern.
It really is a stunning piece of architecture and just next door to the city palace It is just at the back of the city of Palace.

Its a site of scientific marvel. Do visit it. 

The premises also have a light & sound show .. since it is in the city you wont have a problem of riding back in an auto. 

i haven't seen the light & sound show though I was really taken back on the way in which the whole place has been done. Super technology.. What surprises me the  most is the amount of knowledge that was available even during those years and how it has been put to good use. Must... Engineering excellence and great place to spend time with family. Study the scientific methods adopted by the ancient kings. An art of excellence.

Raja Jaisingh was a strong believer in Astrology, hence to study it better he has built couple of astrology complexes, Jaipur is the biggest one. You need to hire a guide here for... Astounding place When you consider the time it was built.  Try not to get there in the midday sun as we did. We couldn't do justice to the place as it was just too hot (in July).

I think all today's science are inspire by them This is a must see. After visiting all the palaces and temples this was a breath of fresh air. What a clever King! They are not only abut power and money. They are brainy too. So amazing to see how the clocks work. Can sit... Not very well maintained and More prominent description required instead of the small plaques currently available. Recommended for people who have some idea or interest in astronomy/astrology. It shows how scientifically advanced people in those times were. I like how brightly painted all of the concrete objects are at this site.  It rained when we were there but was still very beautiful and colorfully vivid. Like the place, interesting tools. Loved it to listen to the audio guide. It's a father talking to his sun/daughter in such an idiotic way. And after their explanations you still don't understand any of it haha. But overall, nice place to visit and its... The response is natural but it may also be seen from the point of view that all visitors are not technical and, therefore, since the subject at Jantar Mantar is very technical, the language and style of communication has designed for understanding of all -... For those interested in the stars, this is a must-see. This UNESCO World Heritage Site can be overwhelming so do ensure you have read up on everything adequately or at least have a guide with you explaining the importance of the various features to you... Amazing what the forefathers of India could envisage and come up with. Close to the city and wind palace, this is a must see for Jaipur.

We visited the Jantar Mantar during our last trip through Jaipur and enjoyed time spent at this UNESCO World Heritage attraction located just across from the City Palace in the Pink City.  

The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is the largest and best preserved of Sawai... This place is really really cool. Although they don't tell you how it all works it's amazing to see that these instruments are that old. Entrance fee is 150 rupees (overseas visitors) and it's open from 9 am to 5 pm.

Observatory with instruments and buildings to know the exact time, the stars, and the signs of the zodiac. Very interesting. Jantar Mantar of Jaipur has lost its charm.

The guide was informative and we found the whole visit very interesting. Worth a visit whilst in...

Lots of neat structures that track the movement of the heavens! Also fairly cheap from... It might be hot as there is concrete everywhere and few places to find shelter, but the time pieces here are amazing. Working out the angle of the stars for the horoscopes makes it even more interesting. Interesting side trip. Its an old observatory that is accurate today and used to teach local kids. I wouldnt really go out of my way to see it if its not part of the program you are on. Lots of stuff to look at, not much information about it all, all feels a little flat. Good currency rates at the bookshop though The whole area is well maintained but somehow too new to feel that they are built many hundred years ago plus very crowdy tourists all over the place which makes the visit a bit challenging. You will need a very good guide who knows a... From Wiki, Jantar Mantar is an installation of astronomical instruments built by Maharaja Jai Singh II.  This was another stop on the tour with Friendly Planet.  We were luckier than other tour groups as our guide was personal friends with one of the PhD's on... Was all this stuff built in this spot?

Get a guide or buy one of the excellent books from the shop as either will help you understand... To really appreciate this place you need a guide; however, the architecture alone is worth a visit. Do a little reading before your visit to get the most out of the structures. Photographers will love the early morning or late afternoon lighting. What can I say, Jaipur is a fantastic city.

This is a 5 minute stop on a day tour - make sure you go at the right time to enjoy it and capture a few nice pictures. Its difficult to understand that what is this ! Should take good guide to enjoy the trip.My kids enjoyed but I & my husband became bore with the place ,even we were sorry for our money what we spent for buying tickets. You could say if you see one sun dial you have seen them all, but this is different, from sun dials that tell time (30 sec accurate) to the big sun dial that is accurate to 2 seconds!! And it is 400 years old.
There... Jantar mantar  structures can only be appreciated by seeing them physically. We are not into astronomy and the explanations were a bit heavy for us, but does not take away the merits of the amazing instruments. Pictures do not do justice to the scale of these structures. Even if you're not into astronomy, see this site. If you are seeing a number of the main tourist sites in Jaipur, it is worth it to buy the composite ticket which is good... This was a really worthwhile trip here and our guide for the day made us aware of the significance of the buildings and instruments. It's worth it to invest in a tour guide and learn some cool stuff about astronomy and astrology.  This outdoor ""museum"" was so different and unique, and it was amazing to consider how they ever came up with these instruments way back when!  Fantastic photo... Really interesting to walk around and admire the architecture, but you need to know more than a little bit about astrology to appreciate it fully, unless you pay for a guide (which can be a bit of a rip off for tourists).

Best visited relatively early in the morning. This was a fascinating experience.

Jantar Mantar, an astrological site and also on UNESCO list. Brought back my little knowledge about galaxy. Very interesting. There is a gigantic time counter, accuracy to 2 seconds. It also has cosmic sets to calculate position of earth against zodiac stars, which... Not good visit if you are not interested in astrology, numbers and instruments! we went all together with family it was good overall but having all age groups together didn't do justice to the place. If you are in photography this is the place to visit in Jaipur. Unbelievable fine structures preserved for nearly 300 years. Late in the day the low sun gives a wonderful and beautiful glow to the stone structures. I find it very average and with lack of detailed information on the mechanics placed there. It would have been more helpful if there was detailed information placed there and not every time you have to take guide. However it is well maintained and worth... it is informative place and shows you how people in bast time were smart and able to build intelligent stuff Stunning display of the humanistic and scientific advances (in India) we in the Western world often neglect. jantar mantar are a lovely palace in the jaipur nice location and nice inverement at jaipur. jantar mantar is a old historical palace at the jaipur. jaipur city provide a travellers safe and securety Hi Friends,

Well kept and in working order, we got a good guide explain different instruments (of extra ordinary scale). preferably with the same guide. Quick half-hour jaunt around better and better equipment, culminating in the largest sundial. Things could be fairly accurate in the days before atomic clocks Jantar Mantar - the Observatory - for me is No. 2 attraction in Jaipur, together with the City Palace, and only after Amber Fort and Palace. It was amazing to see sun dials which measure the time with precision of 4 seconds, and other sophisticated... It's more nerdy impressive...but it's still a wonder to giant instruments forecast the weather, tell time, etc. This is one place i repeatedly visit whenever i am in jaipur.

We were very impressed that such advanced knowledge and expertise was available at that... Excellently maintained, clean and a not-to-be- missed attraction of Jaipur!

Good maintenance compared to the Delhi jantar mantar. However, make sure you take a guide and plan a half day trip to appreciate the knowledge of the architects who built it. What a unique, interesting, awe-inducing place! I got an audio tour and I still didn't really understand anything but I never ceased to admire or be in wonder of these ancient solar instruments. It is unlike anything I've seen! Definitely worth it!

We had a... it is good but not so much attractive but when you reach Jaipur this is the monuments you have to see after Amber Fort . so i can say ok for that Excellence from the point at that time:
1) knowledge.
2) architecture.
3) designs & patterns.
4) evolution of science.
5) brilliance of minds. The observatory was probably the highlight of Jaipur for me, and one of my top 5 things in Rajasthan.

i dont have a huge interest of knowledge of astronomy - but i still found it fascinating.

Built by one of the kings of Jaipur, who... It is fascinating if you are into astrology & astronomy & physics... The audio guide was a bit confusing. I think the audio guide suits school students. Otherwise, get a guide who can simplify and explain the important bits!

We wandered around this interesting site for more than an hour and marveled at the different shapes and objects.

The complex is bigger than we expected and we were so glad we had our guide with us who could answer all our questions, take us to the best spots for taking photos and generally enhanced our visit no end.

This observatory contains some fascinating structures, bring a guide-book to understand. Not much shade, so avoid in the summer! It's great trying to work out how these massive pieces of equipment were actually used.  Enough differences from the one in Delhi to make it worth while visiting both.

Well, at least... I have been to so many museums and places like the Greenwich observatory but this place really excited me. I was amazed at the accuracy of the devices here for telling the time and astrological signs, it is a testament to the great mathematicians and... The fascinating part about Jantar Mantar was the fact that the kings of yore had the foresight and scientific bent of mind to construct such intriguing instruments. It can get a little crowded during the day, but is worth the visit Slightly bored since I have no interest in astrology although I didn't mind having a look around. Even if you stop in for a nice quiet rest from the busy city outside the gates I'm not really into astrology/astronomy etc but this place would be good if you are and also if the sun is shining strongly.  It was a bit. Loudy so we couldn't see the giant sun dials working which was a shame.  The only really disappointing... to be able to determine the time and built instruments to tell time in 1700s was truly remarkable.

A must see for anyone apart from Amber Fort Impressed that these ancient structures are still valid today.

My guide told me that today the forcast of how hot the summer moths will be is done by these instruments and... As a site this didn't do much for me, but my husband thought it was great! Obviously observatories aren't my thing! Amazing what they could figure out scientifically way back when.  Only scientific or astrologers would truly appreciate this place. this is one of the most unusual sites I have ever been. Full of amazing accurate and innovative MASSIVE astrological instruments.

I wish we got a guide to take us round as the audio-guide did not give enough information.... but really interesting A great place to visit if you believe that our ancestors were a great scientist and they have very good knowledge of astronomy (moons, planets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies). Even today some of the instruments are in working conditions. Don’t forgot to see the sun... few tips before visiting.

It is amazing to see the well-maintained ancient astronomical instruments here including the largest sun dial in the world. Some of these instruments are still being used by students during exams ! It was very cool to know that this was the location of the world's largest sundial accurate up to 2 seconds, and that still today the government astronomers still make reference to the tools created there. The sight is mostly made up of dozens of... All the instruments are very accurate and amazingly so! The place is well looked after .This was not really my kind of thing but some people would find this scientific park very interesting. Once again I must say that govt. agency should leave the heritage property and items.

Built by  Maharaja Jai Singh II  between 1727 and 1734 its quite a marvel. It is quite amazing that all those years ago instruments were built, with such accuracy. It is still used today by local astronomers.

The equipment was used for predicting eclipses, tracking... I've been to Jantar Mantar twice, both times in the hot midday sun and both times after an exhausting visit to Amber Fort.  So whenever we come here, I am out of enthusiasm and energy to appreciate the impressive science of this park containing very... This is a collection of restored but working astronomical instruments.

Instruments that measure the suns elevation throughout the year and earth's... Very interesting.  Learn how people studied the stars and kept accurate time without the use of computers or telescope's.  Good for people interested in astronomy or astrology.

Interesting to tour this site and to understand the degree of precision that had been achieved for astromony measurement.  The site was constructed in the early 1700's, but for some reason just doesn't look that old.

This was another place where a tour guide was... The Jantar Mantar at Jaipur is a remarkable place. It has carefully built devices that allowed astronomers to compute (with high precision) simple things like time of day and complex things like when the next eclipse is going to happen. They also allowed people to... The place has a huge scientific/astronomical significance. Apparently, the buildings as well as the instruments were used to make some major astronomy calculations, while i have no interest in the astronomy, these people were actually able to use the structures for scientific use means its...

The signs are written in very scientific language that was difficult to understand.  

Nonetheless,... This site is important in the history of the region, but it is mostly focused on instruments and landmarks used to determine the horoscope of the new born.  Only worth a short visit.

Im not too keen in astronomy as my partner but to those who were will truly be amazed visiting here. A mesmerising place with large-scale astronomical devices to predict sun, planets and even star positions... Jantar Mantar certainly makes for great photographs and can be very informative but there was simply way too many people when we visited, limiting how much you could enjoy it. There must have been around 3 schools visiting at once, many of which were consisted... Its a must visit place in Jaipur. But it is advisable to take a guide. First I tried to move around myself. But was unable to understand anything. Guide helped us to understand the functions and operations of the instruments.

The history of the instruments themselves were interesting. A good fit to visit alongside the wind and city palaces. it is more like things ordinary people don't like. some kind of ancient professional place. it is not worth the time to visit. instead you can visit the nearby places like city palace and hawa mahal. Its a very good place to visit. But you need more time to understand how the stuff there works.
It's very interesting to see that in old days they could do lot of things without much of the modern day equipments.

They could even calculate... Observatory, but you have to have a guide to understand it.  Alot of astronomy terms and function that I did not get.  It looks repetitive to the untrained eye. Kind of looks like a giant sculpture park. Without a guide or at least a book, you won't know what is going on.  Neat in a cerebral sense, especially if you like astronomy.  Buy the city pass to also get into Hawa Mahal for a... This place is a giant astronomical observatory used by the local Maharaja in the early 18th century.  The giant sundial is precise to two second intervals - brilliant!

That was the part I like. For the rest once you understand one, well the rest... A huge astronomical observatory - used hundreds yest ago for calculation of the sun and stars position. You can also find there most likely the largest solar clock.

What made this visit a bit exciting was the snake charmer outside . The snake seemed... This was included in our tour package and I am so glad we were able to visit this observatory and see the instruments used back in history. Some still use today. The sun dial is impressive - apparently the biggest one on the world. Jantar Mantar gives you a great perspective on how scientifically advanced the Indian culture was during the Mughal empire.  I would highly recommend getting the audio guide rather than a real guide.  Real guides rush you through the place just so they can get paid... the technology used for the sound & Light show at the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur brings alive the history of astronomy If you really understand the procedure to measure the distance and positions of heavenly bodies than this is the place. Avoid the light and sound show (it's really nothing) Need a guide to fully appreciate this gem. You will be surprised at the accuracy in the astronomy and the solar system. Nice grounds to roam around as well. Also, some unusual trees on this property. Amazing stuff that was developed hundreds of years ago that still work today. A must see. Has the largest sun dial in the world apparently. Just mind blowing the knowledge of astronomy and astrology that people had back then.

Also, it was crazy busy due to Christmas vacations and jostling through crowds to... If you love astronomy - or want to take some great photos - or are merely curious - visit. It is right across from the City Palace and included in the 2 day combo ticket. This historic UNESCO site features monumentally sized, incredibly precisely calibrated astronomical measurement tools that are a testament to the advanced technology of the Mugal empire.

It stands as a tribute the Mugal rulers who understood the value of education, science and the accumulation of knowledge.... i was just gobsmacked at this observatory. i was there on Dec 21st the shortest day which made it more special. It is incredible how accurate the sundials are considering they were made nearly 300 years ago. my guide was very informative which helped to...

We took a guided tour and when he started explaining everything, we were JAW Dropped. For the first time I came to know, that... It is really amazing the detailed technology used at that time and in a sunny day you can see that some instruments, very well conserved, still work very accurately. It is really amazing and worth a visit. Somehow I fail to understand that years ago, how could someone make these devices to give accurate results.. hats off!
One should spend considerable amount of time to witness and appreciate the UNESCO world heritage site! It's very impressive to see a more than 30 meter high sundial that messure the time in seconds!
Almost unbelievable that all these instruments are so correct in messurering. The real, working sun dials, astrology ""clocks"", etc, make this intriguing and educational. This does not need a lot of time, and it is well located in town. This is really interesting. It takes a little while to work out how some of these 17C instruments work but its worth the effort. We visited around noon which is the best time to see some of the instruments particularly the accurate to 2 seconds... We found this observatory very interesting & the precision that was used in the construction  of the instruments considering that these were done in the 1700s is truly amazing. The history is fascinating so make sure that you go with a guide & also make... This place is fascinating for astromomers and anyone interested in time devices. The engineering is staggering. A Must See while in Jaipur. Just opposite the City Palace this observatory tells you how a king watched the stars. Interesting, because the Polar star (of the north pole) you will just see above the horizon. Because we sre here in tropical altitudes! I had wanted to see this for years, and when I eventually did I was not disappointed. To me the best part of our visit to Jaipur.

The astrological instruments there are amazing.  You can walk in and through them - try to get inside... This huge complex is an interesting and very educational tour of ancient astrology. One can actually tell the time and date by the sun in these huge structures. Very worth the visit. This is a unique site from all the moseliums and forts. This was an unexpected pleasure.

He also spoke of how important the alignment of the stars was used... Great observatory! Wonderful techniques used in old time to read time with an accuracy of 2 seconds. Amazing. The astronomical instruments were fascinating. Our guided tours was excellent. I would recommend everyone going to Jaiput never to miss this spectacular site. Great unique place to visit in India.  This outdoor observatory was great, especially with a good guide (either a written one or or a reliable guide - we took the city of Jaipur tour, held by a quirky moustachioed gent who knew his stuff). It... Get the 2 day composite ticket and enjoy Jantar Mantar, Albert Hall, Hawa Mahal, Nahargarh and Amber fort. Jantar Mantar is very clean inside and the guards are ever watchful. However lack of literature depicting the history may be a dampener but if you have... This is a more advanced construction than the jantar Mantar at Delhi. This is just opposite to the city palace in Jaipur. The scientific detail of the place blew our mind away. To imagine that in that day and age such science existed and was used was amazing to realise I did not have much expectations even after reading some good reviews about the place here. But i must say that I was truly bowled over by the skills the builders had. At the first look, it might just look like structures which makes absolutely... I only went to Jantar Mantar because it was on the tour.  But what a wonderful place and I stayed way longer than planned.  Luckily we had our own car, guide and driver and didn't have to keep to any schedule.  I just kept wandering... It was cool to see what people used to use back in the days, but don't hold your breath. If you have to choose between two attractions, just skip this one.

You will see many instruments, and structure used to study the sky and measuring distance of the... do visit, if u have any interest in science or astronomy. its fascinating to see such things were built so many year ago & its still working with accuracy. do hire a guide (rs 200, for ~30-40 mins) & do read all the info at... Our driver wasn't that keen for us to go into this one but it was really cool. 

It has all these crazy contraptions to tell the day, time and the stars! Jantar Mantar is a very interesting place. If you visit, I would suggest you get a tour guide who, unlike an audio tour, can demonstrate how all the measuring instruments worked. We didn't spend long here, maybe 1 hour in total, but I was pleased... Intriguing place, a masterpiece in astronomy, maintained quite well. Recommended even if one is not a science enthusiast. 

Take your time to look around this place, and ensure you have a guide or a guidebook to tell you what each exhibit is about. Otherwise it... very well maintained.  Shows our rich heritage.  educational for the kids, infact for all of us. must visit place You can skip if you are not astronomically inclined. 

If you do not have the background of astronomy, you wont be able to appreciate the instruments in Jantar mantar. The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is an extraordinary World Heritage Site artifact. The collection of building sized-structures are extremely precise instruments for measuring solar and celestial events. Do not miss it during your visit to Jaipur. Being a World heritage site, Jantar mantar has been maintained fairly well. Ideally, a trip would be incomplete without a guide as they would clearly explain how these ancient instruments were used to accurately tell time; most of which are accurate till date. You will... For astrology buffs, this is heaven. Amazing how a king from that era made this laboratory possible. Very nice place, well maintained. It is better to go there with a guide. They explain each and every instrument. Accuracy of the same is amazing and makes you feel proud to be an Indian. This is the only complete Jantar Mantar in India so is better than the one... Again I took the guide but this time the guide was not very polite in talking. He seemed to be in a hurry to get some some other customer. There are audio guides also which one can try. Jantar means instruments mantar means calculations as... The equipment still show accurate time after all these years. I think you need a guide for this because they can explain clearly how you can read the time off the instruments. Its located next to City Palace. It is recommended to buy one ticket to see all the places covered under ASI. You need time to see this place. Go with a guide to understand technicals of Jantar Mantar. Visited Jantar Mantar for less than a hour. Surely missed a lot.
The problem is that they close sharp 5:00, actually they'll push you out by 5:05.

Take some time and take either Guide or Audio guide with you, to explain how the different structures... Kind of random, but it is certainly unique and worth checking out on your trip through Jaipur. Doesn't require a huge time commitment, and it's not every day you get to explore a collection of giant tools for astrological measurements built by a maharaja. Unless you have an understanding and appreciation for astrology, it's not interesting. The structures you see and what they accomplished in their time can't really be appreciated if you don't have a background un the science. I didn't find the guide very helpful in piquing... One is simply ""AWESTRUCK"", by the detailing of each equipment of this ""SUN DIAL"" or Jantar Mantar. This was built by the founder of Jaipur who was himself a great astronomer. Here you can not only follow the guide who tells you about the use... This observatory has been build by Maharaja of Jaipur as he was also interested in astrology. Still this is the only working observatory in India. Hats off to the ancient age people who were having such deep knowledge i wished there were more English local guides with good accent .can you pls provide one paper sheet in Persian explainantion ? that would be gread, because there are many and many iranian tourist who visit there. It s so amazing to discover the enormous knowledge the founder of the Jantar Mantar had to be able to build such useful and precise tools to measure the distances between the celestial bodies.
It requires a deep knowledge of Astronomy and Astrology and it... It is incredible to think that these 'instruments' were built so many years ago and are so accurate.   Maharaja (King) Jai Singh II, not happy with a sundial accurate to 20 seconds had another one built which is accurate to two seconds.

A guide is... good to visit once to appreciate the geniusness of our ancient people for their knowledge. Without guide you will not understand the concepts. The guide charge 300 for 5-10 people. We shared shared this with another group. this place represent the brilliance of founder of Jaipur.. Swat Jai Singhji . you need a good guide to understand the logic behind each structure in premises.. Can not imagine how the scientific watch hav been made. It is superb example of human intelligence and accuracy. Hire a guide who will explain you everything about the time calculations. This heritage site is still maintained well. Good for children as this interests them very much. Sure to have nice memories. 
Buy a composite pass for some 5 attractions as it turns out cheaper. 
Take a guide the experience would be enriching. It only costs... This place give you hope for thehumn race, unlike the rest of India's filthy streets. The audio guide is extremely funny if you have a dry sense of humour and informative. Lots of fun for nerds!

It is also quite well maintained compared to many other historical places). Of course, you may see some...

Fun morning in Jaipur Take Guide for sure at Jantar Mantar, then only we can understand... Really amazing, specially Sun Dial, match the time with your watch... Well, if you are not a littel bit scientific it's a bit difficult to understand. interesting to see how men are able to make things to progress Nicely maintained place. You need to have a Guide to understand the sculptures or you can take the Audio Guide at reasonable price. Was great wandering through the Jantar Mantar. I had not been there in over 30 years, and the place has been cleaned up and well kept. Compared to the Jantar Mantar we visited in New Delhi, this was much bigger and better. Very interesting place to visit and worth checking out. enjoyed the science and discoveries of the kings.... really amazed at how advanced and intelligent they were in their time. I found this very dull.  Lots of huge sundials, and I mean huge, all very clever in their time but just not my thing. This was right opposite the City Palace, so we figured it positively rude not to pop in. Now you'll have to excuse me if I get this wrong, but like I said, it appears his Highness had a thing for not only astrology but astronomy... Interesting stop in Jaipur. Includes large ""time keeping"" devices and astrological instruments. Must visit on a sunny and clear day though. And be sure to go with a guide who can demonstrate how the instruments are used. This is an amazing set of instruments, some are still working. We were shown how the different instruments were used to tell time from the position of the sun. It wasn't too crowded when we were there and we had time to look and take... This is reputedly the best Jantar Mantar in India; it was good to see it in such good condition - restoration and conservation has been carried out in a very professional way. Good to pay a bit extra for a guide - helps make sense... This place is surprising and interesting. It is very informative also. I was just curious. These instruments seems accurate, most surprisingly the Sundial with an error margin of just fifteen minutes. One of the oldest preserved structure in Jaipur. Nice to see. It is very well kept and still working, this world heritage place built by the Maharadja Jai Singh in 1734. It is still working These 300 year old, huge stone instruments look quite surreal, but they do work, and very exactly even. Here it really pays to get a guide who can explain the features of these instruments to you and how they were created. One of our trip... Its a treat for those who love astronomy. The huge instruments built will make us in awe that such things were created so long ago. I have mixed feeling about taking the guide since I definitely felt there was difference in the content given by... What an extraordinary place, created by the Maharaja in the 18th century to solve problems with telling the time and to satisfy his own curiosity about the movement of the planets and the stars.
The Observatory looks like a giant's playground, filled as it is... when I arrived here it was the middle of the day so it was quite crowded with tour groups. I think it would have been more enjoyable had there been less people.  Being larger than the Jantar Mantar in Delhi I decided to visit this... Mind blowing accuracy of all the apparatus.   Have to take a guide if you want to really know what you are seeing.  Very knowledgeable guides and value for money Really a moving experience. Eye=opening to see the extent of advances made in India at this time in history and the intellect of the King who conceptualized the strucutre. A fascinating place. Even if you don't understand how everything has been used, you can still enjoy the fabulous architecture and design. Truly beautiful. the palace is very interesting for the student who is interested to be a astrology . there are lots of big and small stechu and also the way is good park and you can be spend some hours there specially when you travel with your... If you are going here, and I'm not saying it isn't a fantastic sight, make sure you do your googling before you go. The guide books they sell are pretty poor - basically just reiterating the information on the blocks by the side of the... Super futuristic observatory with amazing architecture that actually works as astrological data collection and pretty garden areas.  This is a UNESCO site and well worth visting since it's near the overrated City Palace (within close walking distance). Jantar mantar has all the astronomical monuments but understanding only based on the description alone. Someone needs to explain to help you understand and appreciate them Evening sound and light show happens everyday at 6:30 pm in English and 7:30 pm in Hindi.
Enrty fee for Eng is INR 200 and for Hindi it is INR 100 each.
Its all about the history of Jantar Mantar and Swai Raja Jaisingh II.... It's adjacent to the Palace so easy to include in your visit. However, you don't need more than 30 minutes there, unless you happen to be a student of astronomy! Can't beleive what they could do in the 1700 century it is amazing.A skill perhaps we have lost to computers! Guide was very good at explaining things. really cool outdoor astrology structures from the 1700s.  Best part is how all the structures create a neat visual as you look across the 2ish acre area. To see how accurate the structures in this observatory are, is truly wonderful. The giant sun dial is my fave. Wondering how these structures are able to show the exact time.... Guide or all information before hand will help understanding this place,,, The highlight of my whole India trip.  We had a specialist guide who was brillaint, his knowledge of astronomy and astrology was second to none, within seconds did all the groups star signs, ascending and descending and his explanations of each of the instruments grabbed... There could have been more attractions built around the facility to make it more informative and entertaining. Great opportunity to see giant ancient observatory. Giant sundial is accurate to 2 seconds a year. Astrology was/is very important to many Indians. We took an audio tour of the Jantar Mantar and were truly amazed by the knowledge and the scientific acumen of the king who constructed it. One definitely needs to spend some time trying to understand the various instruments - around 15 - that are... Jantar Mantar is beautiful , its situated nearby the City Palace, few minutes walking distance. It has varios inventions created by Jaipur's old royals and their scientists. Focusing on the zodiac and astronomy. Its truly an amazing site and makes for great photos and memories.... The less crowded it is when you visit the better you will like it. The astronomical sculptures are truly fascinating. The structures are a brilliant.It is a strange architecture with many staircases running form different sides. The entire area is surrounded by beautiful gardens. We saw jantar mantar which is opposite to city palace.The whole monument is calm and peaceful and clean.You need a guide to understand and appreciate only after lisning to them.Good place an must see in jaipur plan A really interesting sight but like many things in India there aren't enough signs to tell you what the instruments do If you don't have a guide this is going to be a tricky one (unless you can appreciate the objects simply for the way they look). Some of it was still beyond me (both the why and the how), even with a guide. Our guide... In order to appreciate this sight, you really need to read about, or get some knowledge about, the ancient knowledge of Vedic astronomy which informs it. While not ancient itself, this unique and impressive construction is based on advanced astronomical knowledge many thousands of years... There was a time when this place was not visited by many however since it has been selected as a World Heritage Site, the footfall has increased tremendously. There is a audio guide available, however Hindi version is not yet there, hence I strongly recommend... It should be an incredible attraction, but in truth it is a little lack lustre. A lot more could be made of this inceredible feat of geometry. Best of all the attractions.   Well maintained.  
day time visit. Informative. Light and sound show is not worth. I naively thought that audio guide would do the explaining at Jantar Mantar. Well it is one place you should spend on a guide who knows his geometry and how it's used to find the position of planets in the celestial sphere. try to get a great guide or get a book about it to read. it was a great place to visit and unbelievable structures but without any reliable information, you will be stuck staring at the structures and try to figure out by yourself. this... It is the largest stone observatory in the world and fascinating to see both the structures and people from around the world engaging with them. I probably should have taken the audio tour to get more undertsanding of it. This is excellent place to learn about the India kings having scientific temperament. Cleanliness around this place need to be improved. This was a fascinating albeit slightly frustrating place. We took an audio guide and found it quite difficult to find all the exhibits in numerical order. The commentary was somewhat childish, but overall the whole thing was spectacular. If you have time, you must see... This is an observatory of huge instruments that were used to tell time and are very accurate. The instruments are well preserved with many still usable.  This is well worth seeing. We visited this observatory as part of a school visit travelling around India. It was built in 1720 and way ahead of its time. The accuracy and scale of the instruments is impressive. It is all very exposed and was hot the day we were... How incredible, to be created in the first place and to survive today. Beautifully kept this is well worth a visit. You don't need a guide if you speak English as each instrument has information in Indian and in English. There are toilets and a... To get the best from Jantar Mantar you need a good guide who really knows about the instruments and how they were used.  There is no shade, so go as early as you can if your trip is in the summer.  You need an hour... I would thoroughly recommend a trip to Jantar Mantar but only if you hire a guide (very cheap at 200 rupees). You definitely need the guide to explain how all the instruments work. This is a fascinating place for anyone vaguely interested in astronomy and... We visited last time we came in 2006 but wanted to see it again. The massive sun dials are amazing and our guide was able to explain their accuracy along with how the astrology sections were used. Clever and amazingly accurate engineering. This place is a must visit. To have these instruments in those days was unbelievable. To calculate time upto 2 sec using sunlight was amazing. I felt Rs 200 guide charge was too much. If not for the guide I wouldn't have known anything. This is the most significant, most comprehensive, and the best preserved of India's historic observatories Designed for the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye worth doing if you have an hour to spare For anybody with even the most rudimentary interest in astronomy this place is a revelation!  Constructed at a time when the inquisition still persecuted us for saying the Earth was NOT flat...I spent two hours here with a very knowledgeable guide, and learned a lot! Huge park filled with outstanding astronomical instruments that could predict weather, horoscopes, etc I think that although this is an interesting place it is overpriced (250 rupees - Dec 2012 ). Reminded me of walking through a Salvador Dalí painting, the astronomical structure were so surreal. English information plaques next to each structure giving useful information. If your... We were not expecting the amazing observatory of Jantar Mantar.  The astronomical structures are huge and look modern in their design.  It was a very impressive and educational site.  it is well worth a visit! This remarkable astronomical and astrological observatory was built in the 18th century yet is accurate even today to within two-tenths of a second. Because it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the prices have been pushed up.  It's worth seeing however, but probably either early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the shadows are long. Very well kept monument and quite astounding how accurate it is considering when it was built. Much more comprehensive than I thought it would be. Fascinating place. It was well explained in English on boards by each instrument, the place was clean and tidy. If you are in Jaipur, don't leave before visiting Jantar Mantar... even if you are clueless about such things, the guides can give you a glimpse into what the weird and wonderful structures are capable of... 

Not having a real idea of what I was... This was a very interesting site in the heart of Jaipur's old town.

The size and complexity of some of the instruments was unbelievable given their age. I would definitely recomment a visit here if you're in Jaipur. I'd read about this place, but the size and scope of it was amazing. It's all very clean and well cared for and our guide provided us with all sorts of fascinating facts. It was a hot day and my scarf wasn't really adequate. Should... The accuracy of these 300 year old sundials is astounding, but it's worth taking a guide to understand what you are looking at. Certain instruments are still used to predict the directions of the Monsoon and hence the size of the harvest. So many thanks to Around In Indias and our guide Gopal (probably the best driver in India) for his kindness and time he spent with us, allowing us to discover a non tourist face of India with all its colours, aromas of typical Indian food,... A must visit to marvel at the scientific knowledge possessed all those years ago (this was built in 1718 AD). Definitely use a guide to see a demo of all the instruments (Jantar) built there. Very impressive structures but I wish the descriptions were more in detail for a common man to understand. It was very crowded mostly with school children when we were there. Be prepared with hats and water as it can get very hot out in the... We got a very good guide to tell us each and every thing in Jantar mantar and put us in great astonishment. We found that most of the clocks are still working and the perfection is just two seconds ... Surprise. nicely maintained. hire a guide...he will explain all the instruments & their calcultion well.very neat & clean. We had a guide who explained every device in this fascinating observatory.Remarkable that Sawai Jai singh was such a smart person and ahead of his time.My son liked the big sundial the best. Totally over-rated; dirty; strong pungent smell of urine; small explanatory signages are not comprehensible; should be made easier for people to understand Excellent work by the erstwhile Jaipur kings, who seemed to have a lot of prosperity and leisure to expend on scientific and other pastimes. The place is small and crowded, but the astronomical equipment is curious and worth seeing once. Signage is inadequate, and though... I'm with the previous (for me) reviewer.  You need an explanation in plain English.  The instruments are fascinating from small to enormous.  An hour should do it though, as you get astralabed out PDQ. This place has a collection of instruments built in ancient times, to study the movement of the different celestial bodies. Worth visiting. Again take a guide without which you would be lost. I wish I had read about it before visiting, to understand the concepts better. This is an amazing piece of early astrology with the construction of various instruments to enable them to tell the time accurately.  It was considered import from an astronomy and astrology perspective.  The largest instrument is huge and enabled them to tell the time accurate... The builders believed in astrology (as many people does nowadays). This made them to study the sky to measure the time, and the stars position when someone was born. The went on and on, and built an incredible and accurate set of instruments (some of... ...but my girlfriend was bored and couldn't stand in the sun so she waited under a tree while I gleefully tried to figure out how the instruments were used.  A guidebook or some previous research would be useful, because the signs don't explain well enough... If one is in jaipur for 2 days, get a composite ticket, which worksout cheaper - this includes Jantar Mantar, Amber palace, Jaigarh fort, Nahargarh fort, Albert Museum etc.
Best of the Jantar Mantar here. Written text beside each monument; hence, can avoid guides.
Takes... We were taken here by our guide. It is pretty amazing to think someone knew all this back then, however there's not a ton to see. Worlds largest sun dial, some other ways to tell astrology signs on different days. We were able to cover... This site is a fascinating collection of instruments which had many uses, both practical and mystical. The largest sundial in the world is here which tells the time accurate to 20 seconds. Also there are 12 separate dials, one for each sign of the zodiac,... This was an interesting place to wonder around. The weird sculptures around the place made it feel as if you were in Alice in Wonderland. All the sculptures were used as an observatory. Interesting to learn how they measured things back in the day. This is a most interesting place especially if you have a guide who understands how the instruments work. Well worth a visit but allow a bit of time to see and understand. It was interesting to see all the astronomical and astrological instruments, although nothing very spectacular except giant, high resolution sundial. As featured in the movie ""The Fall,"" this small park features many fascinating architectural astronomical objects that are fascinating. It's adjacent to Jaipur City Park and is a must-see while you are in Jaipur! Bring sun screen. Jantar mantar was built by the ruler of Jaipur in addition to Jaipur at Delhi, Varanasi, Mathura and Ujjain.  The huge sundial can indicate the time to the accuracy of upto 2 seconds.  There are other instruments called yantra's.  There are also smaller Sun dials.... Did not fully appreciate the size of the individual items on this site.  With hindsight a tour guide would have been very useful to explain each of the items, although there are descriptions to help.  Do this in conjunction with the city palace in an... Excellence of engineering. very good sample of engineering past decade. At that time engineer was also inteligent and that is a example For anyone with a mildly scientific or astronomical interest, this place is an amazing sight and almost unique historical record of how the ancients watched and recorded the sun. stars, time and date. It is also clear that they could build sizeable structures with great... This one is for the astronomy geeks - the large sculptures/contraptions show how the earth and sun positions were caclulated. While it was interesting, it got a little boring for us. Perhaps if we got a guide (we used the audio tour) it would have... We were fascinated by Jantar Mantar and amazing to find out how accurate these enormous ""instruments"" were.   It is a must see and  it is so close to the City Palace We had no idea what we would find there, but were absolutely blown away by what we saw!  Take the time to explore all of the astronomical devices in the area.  It is a real testament to people with vision and scientific understanding!  Having a... So, you might not be able to understand it all, but someone did and that's how it came to be.  What an amazing place.  You can't help but wonder why so many time telling devises were necessary, but that only adds to it being impressive. We had a wonderful guide who explained the buildings and the ways of measurement and calculations. If you imagine that these were built around 1730, it is even more impressive. Worth a visit if you are still able to listen to a guide, otherwise just... antar Mantar is considered to be one of the largest observatories ever built. Combining religion, science and art, the Jantar Mantar is the name given to a series of five, magnificent structures built in Jaipur, New Delhi, Ujjan, Varanasi and Mathura. Jaipur was the seat... We enjoyed the visit to this site very much. We each had a chance to take photos with all the different astrological observing points.. I wish we had hired a guide to take us thru the site. We were short on time. Still very interesting... Make sure you get a guide who does not hurry his tour and takes time to explain all these sites in detail. If you have already visited the Jantar Mantar in Delhi, you may want to skip it. Unexpected surprise - a stone observatory built by Jai Singh II, a great astronomer.  Located near city palace, largest and best preserved observatory of the lot.  Instruments used by astronomers to measure the positions of the stars and calculate time and eclipses.  Must see if... I was amazed at the seeking to absolute precision of time.  The fact that so many methods were used to get to absolute seconds of time was to me hilarious and time consuming..... that one person could go to such extremes......!!!! i wonder in old days ppl were more knowledgeable regarding astronomy and space science than now.Its a real wonder.
Do take a guide to knw all the stuff.
DO ATTEND THE LIGHT N SOUND SHOW. Had a lot of fun looking at the tools at this observatory!  It was really fascinating to see how people studied astronomy back in the day.  It does get really hot during the day so I'd recommend visiting during the winter months.  We had a... It was amazing journey in January mantar. It is wonderful for somebody design such precise astrological systems without any modern equipments. This is an observatory which has to be seen to be believed.

There are 16 instruments which are stone structures ""resembling a giant... The greatness of Indian intelligence can only be appreciated at this astronomical masterpiece.

During our trip I visited this place at Jaipur. This is very knowledgeable place and I learned lots new things... You have to be bright to get the most out if this extraordinary place. It's a testament to Indian brilliance in measurement and calculation - the same stunning millimetre accuracy you see at the Taj Mahal.  Understanding it is more difficult for ordinary mortals but... We have not enjoyed a lot this place, as it is full of instruments to find out the positions of the stars, etc. We are not experts in astronomy so we only understood 15% of the place. You need a guide with ample experience to explain the concept and the various attributes of this large tribute to all things asterological. Janter manter is in front of City palace.. to understand fully you must need a guide. they will explain how to see the time using the instruments, you can compare it with your watches. it shows the exact time. it shows old days engineering. Place was full of tourists but a good place to see in Jaipur.  Get a guide who speaks good English who can give you the full rundown of the site.  I found it quite interesting though I was very hot walking around.

A few school... This sight is terrific with its history and science. For something so many years ago it is quite amazing. It was very thought provoking and not too overcrowded. There is a wide range of astronomical instruments, built on the initiative of the Maharaja Jai Singh... I had heard a lot about this huge observatory, but to see the precision instruments that allow for a 2-minute exact reading of the time in Jaipur is unique ... .  Beyond that the various instruments are apparently important astrological tools that are used to... Here also everything was nice. I myself got surprised to see such innovating things that today science cant make. It was great. Though here the temperature created problems somehow. Everyone should visit it at the early stage of their visit to Jaipur. This was an interesting place to spend an hour or so.  50 rupees each for tourists.  Dont bother with a guide or the audio guide - you get about the same info from the plaques around each instrument written in English A real treat to engineers,astronomers,scientists .Kudos to Jaipur for managing to maintain these in good condition.The sun dial is a masterpiece. the place had a fabulous work of history with astrology and mathematics.
its a place with superb architecture and historical value. There is no such palce. The actual palce is jantar mantar of jaipur. Request tripadvisor team to remoce this entry as this is creating confusion. Machine calculations .. surprised, well that's what Jantar Mantar literally means. It's a huge astronomical site , and mind you it is still working to date. There is a sundial accurate to 20 secs and a bigger one which is to 2 secs, which is... then this place is cool. From a historical perspective, I could appreciate it, but with regards to its actual usefulness back then would probably be more appreciated by someone who can understand all that astronomy jargon, which I can't. It's worth to visit if you... It is the largest stone observatory in the World and this feature makes it, a special destination for a traveler. It is one of the five astronomical observatories built by Maharaja Jai Singh, the founder of Jaipur. The observatory is very interesting, but would be incomprehensible without a guide.  Our guide cost 200 rupees and spent about 15 minutes explaining how the instruments worked.

The various dials and structures look like some form of marble sculpture, but they are actually scientifically designed... Well worth a visit especially if you like maths/ astronomy/ astrology.  Unfortunately it was so hot when we visited we didn't spend as long as I would have liked.  It was really useful having a guide explain how to tell the time using the instruments This is the hustle and bustle of India! Beautifully painted city provides a backdrop to the chaos of traffic, animals, shop keepers etc. I did not find any thing amusing about the Jantar Mantar - it was same as everywhere. If you haven't visited  any of them, then its good to discover how sunlight was used to keep time. Worth it if you have a guide who can explain the significance of it to you, it's basically and observatory. This Historical place is an amazing mixture of Astronomy and Astrology, using mathematics, though typically rated as an astronomical observatory. It is a collection of architectural astronomical instruments, built by Maharaja Jai Singh II, during 1734. You would practically loose your grip on ground after... Even if you're not an astronomy enthusiast, I think it is a great attraction.  Walking distance from City Palace and aesthetically interesting, it's a terrific stop while in Jaipur.  It doesn't take too long to go through and we hired a guide, which I'm glad... We found the place to very interesting and enjoyed it. Take a guide! Otherwise- dont go.. We visited the one in delhi (which is not as big and nice) and without a guide its just wierd shpes :-) Take a guide/audio guide, otherwise not much use visiting this place. Decent place to visit. Can understand that lot of effort was spent in the olden days to understand the astrology and astro-physics. Very Close to city palace. engineering marvel, just unbelievable..dont miss this and do hire a guide, it's worth spending on guide..
u can even choose audio option but that would be costlier. One look at Jantar Mantar, and you can tell that the king who made it was ""really deep"" into astronomy. The place is a work of art with so many amazing yantras (instruments) which help in understanding various astronomic readings. Its right next to the... jantra Mantar is great place scintific place we must see this place
when at jaipur nice place great history behind it Entrance fee was only 100 rupees but the visitor gets to see all the astrological equipment built over 300 years which are still accurate up to today.

My only regret - not hiring a guide to explain the significance of the various pieces! However, even without that knowledge, you can enjoy the fantastical view... Jantar Mantar has always fascinated me but always difficult to understand. This may be basically as now not many knowledgeable guides are left to explain ful scale astronomical devices. May be I visited on a hot day. Its a place o be in winters with... We visited this place on 14th of Aug and it was rainning that time. So there was no sun and we couldn't see how those instruments actually works. 

The instruments are very huge and looks nice from far away. If you have visited any other... Jantar Mantar is really good!!!
They show us, how before they used to see the time and how to calcul..... because there weren't  watch before When you hear Jantar Mantar, most Indians associate this with hocus pocus - meaning it has to do with magic but it's not. It's all about astronomy. Jantar - machines; Mantar - calculations/science. Using creative constructions of instruments out of rock and other materials, they... There are 10 astonimical instruments. These definitely shows how much we were advanced in astonomy. Definitely good for school going kids If you are a fan of astronomy and ancient science, this is an excellent place to spend a couple of hours discovering how very accurate an old sundial can be in telling the time to within a few fractions of a second. Very well restored... Definitely need a guide for this site, but you won't regret it, this place is full of mind blowing scientific instruments! Even my own watch can't keep time accurate to 1min.  Also the site of the world's largest sun dial.  Without the guide, you won't... Fantastic. Anyone with even a basic interest in astronomy should definitely visit the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur. brain child of a ruler with scientific mind. How very interesting.  Accuracy 2 seconds even now. Too many hawkers though outside and when we visited it was so hot, make sure to bring water and cover for your head. This is an absolute must see in Jaipur. You definitely should take a guide, who explains all the instruments. We were mind blown by the precision of the instruments. A sundial, from which you can read the time with the precision of a second, built... Liked: the inverted dome-shaped Narivalaya Yantra and Jai Prakash Yantra.

Disliked:Open space.If you are visiting during the summer or the monsoons,prepare yourself to get scorched .Else carry an umbrella.Winter is the ultimate time to visit this heritage observatory!! This historic astronomical wonder speaks volume about India’s rich heritage in science and astronomy. This place is totally contrary to the pathetic one that we visited in New Delhi and is well preserved and maintained. It has been inscribed on the World Heritage List as... As th LP said, a bit like being in Alice in Wonderland. Shows the ingenuity that the maharaja Jai Singh had hundreds of years ago. A trip to Jaipur would not be complete without a visit to India's best Jantar Mantar.  It totally beats seeing the Palace located across the street.  This is the only place in India where I recommend purchasing a tour guide to explain how each instrument... Lovely photo opportunity .. However, you should try to get an audio guide as many of the details are lost without one. Don't go with a real live guide, rather a book and audio. Get there early (it opens at 9) as there is no... I wasnt sure if I wanted to see this place, but in the end figured it would be worth the 100 R entrance. On a cooler day it would be a great place to sit and enjoy the views. 
I did enjoy seeing all the... A must go for all tourists. This place shows how well developed we were in astronomy even so long back.... India is great Now this was something I definitely haven't seen anywhere else. India is full of palaces and tombs and forts... but the Jantar Mantar was unique.

It's basically just a big lawn/courtyard of astronomical measuring instruments. You definitely need a guide to make sense of it... This is one of 5 observatories built in India and is the best restored/preserved. The scale of the instruments has to be seen to be believed and compensate for the lack of accuracy of construction with the sheer scale. The mathematics are fairly complex and... Interesting to see as it is such a unique place. It was not easy to work out what everything was for, even with a tour guide explaining! It is a big open place and extremely hot in the midday sun. This place is amazing for admiring knowledge new-age astronoms. Everything looked like the museum of abstraction art inside the skatepark. All the equipment is still functionable. You will just see it all with open mouth. Place is well-maintained with guide services. This Mantar is well maintained and Large. This is more worth wile to visit than the Mantar in Delhi. Jantar Mantar is one of the biggest Sundial of the world and even many more things are there. Just visit this amazing place and find how intelligent was the ruler of Jaipur.But only visit when Sun is on top not in cloudy or fogy weather.... When we entered Jantar Mantar I had not seen anything like it before, wonderful shaped instruments for measuring stars etc. difficult to explain really, even the notices were very difficult to understand, but certainly worth a look. The astronomical observatory without telescopes was built by the then Raja Jai Singh and is one of the best maintained of the five observatories he built in India even though the Jantar Mantar at New Delhi is in a much larger area and has some... Although the builder of Jantar Mantar actually built five of these throughout India, this is supposedly the best preserved one.  If you are interested in science and technology (or just good design), you'll find the place pretty interesting.  Lots of sundiials and astrolabes, but on... A great lesson in history and astronomy. Take a guide with you to help you understand all the different instruments Its great to see how people kept a track on time in old days...Amazing peace of work otherwise they'll be just a lot of very odd looking buildings. Our guide was really informative (and we tried to avoid most guides as they can go on a bit if youre tight on time and overcharge!) and I'm pleased we had him if only... DOnt miss this great attraction, a guide would be worth hiring who can explain the history and instruments built by the maharaja to measure time, long, lat and birth star. Fascinating, even for those with no astrological / astronomical leanings. Generally we are impressed by detail, and impressed by age, this is a wonderful combination of the two. Liked this place a lot and made for some really cool pictures. No guide for this place (the guides are ok, but I preferred to go at my own pace and take pictures). Historic, legend, grok! Felt proud to be an Indian. 

It is still a show case of our capabilities in Astronomy that dates back to many centuries.

One of the few Indian tourist attractions that is maintained resonably clean.

Understand that it is being reccommended to be a world... it is amazing how accurate things were hundreds of years ago, good tour guide, would definitely come back We attempted to do Jantar Mantar on our own and it was probably a mistake.  While the site is interesting we didn't really get a lot out of it as there isn't much information available on what all of the instruments do and how to... Jantar Mantar is like a large adventure playground, but all the pieces are actually astronomical observing instruments on a giant scale. The shop has a book explaining them (not very accurately, but it does explain their purpose). This is a must for scientists and astronomers,... Having previously seen the Jantat Mantir in Dehli on a previous visit to India I was indifferent to the proposed visit .IT was brilliant ,an amazing place to visit .Even though
 It was very hot we did the full tour  and I would say it... Walkable distance from the city palace,this place is a very good place to visit if your interested in astronomy or generally curious about ""how weather and time was predicted in the earlier centuries""
Could be boring if you dont have a guide .Getting a good... It has very good history..must visit place with knowledgable guide. really amazed with some interesting and true facts! Top class place to visit:) Jantar Mantar is fun and educational especially if you have kids. It is a collection of heritage astronomical instruments which are large structures, built by King Jai Singh II between 1727 and 1734.

The observatory consists of fourteen major geometric devices for measuring time, predicting... Honesty is boring. Here is the old observatory that has been used many are lined up. For those who are not interested in astronomy is not just appear as just a little fashionable ruins :(
:(:(:(:(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( If you are in Jaipur I would give this place a look but dont go especially for it.  Its nice enough for 1/2 an hour but no more. Delhi and Agra both have Jantar Mantar and definitely Jaipur's is better one. Get a Guide! This is incrediblely interesting with the right guide! What should have been a interesting visit was not due the awful audio guide (and yet they have always been so good at other places throughout India). Astrology is a complicated subject at the best of times and coupled with a huge array of large... I am not really into astronomy so it didn't really enthrall me as much as it did my friend.  I just sort of went along so probably the problem was me. My friend and I hired a guide (200 INR total), but there is also an audio tour available. You will definitely get more out of this place if you know what you are looking at: It's amazing to think all the work that went into... If you have any sense of wonder at all, you must visit Jantar Mantar. The sheer scale of the structures, their sweeping lines. and their melding of science and occult will seize your imagination. Even tired, hot, and (frankly) a little wowed-out by earlier visits... That's well worth a visit - take a guide if you can, as you learn a lot more than from the signage Nestled away in the backstreets of Jaipur is the outdoor enclosed observatory that is Jantar Mantar.

Jantar Mantar is a collection of astronomic instrument built in the XVII century. If you are a passionate on astronomy, you will really love this place that will make you feel like Alice in Wonderland. If you are not, like me, the 'instruments' will look... Huge astronomical site with some really interesting tools that where used by the Maharajah. The attention to detail to be able to build them so precisely is amazing. They still work now hundreds of years later. I am not into astronomy but I did appreciate... A brilliant collection of astronomical devies from the early 1700s including the ""suicide stairs"", a huge sun dial accurate to 2 seconds. Use the audio guide as the descriptions on the tablets are very hard to follow (we lost our way through some of the... its great .the jantar mantar its sounds great we have been with friends we had great exprience This attraction with its giant sundial is one of the most unique sites that we have ever visited.  It is hard to imagine that these instruments were in place almost 400 years ago. The area was neat and clean. The transportation was easily available. A must visit to jaipur where one should spend quality time Was skeptical before I saw the small and large sun dials in person.  But I was surprised that something built in India back in the 1700's were accurate to the minute!  There were other horoscope related sculptures. While you are in Jaipur, you should visit the Jantar Mantar to understand how the things in their were used to tell the time, date and astrology. After spending 25 years in Jaipur, i never thought that a visit to Jantar Mantar would be this good. Unlike other attractions of jaipur, this one is not a fort and yet is probably the only one that left me awestruck. The accuracy of the... Impressive to witness astronomy studies' equipment built up in brick and mortar, built by the Maharajas of Jaipur. A good guide makes all the difference in explaining the various structures' interface with the planets et al Cool to look around.  If they still let you climb on things, it's even more fun...but I'm not so sure they do. We were taken to this site by our private guide Akram Ali , who we had contacted through he website toursbylocals.com. I must say we would have definitely given this a miss had we been on our own. Having our guide however we were able... This is a surprisingly interesting place to visit, the structures were built centuries ago and are still fairly accurate today, if you are lucky enough to go with a guide he will explain how each structure operates as well as the reason for their construction.... to think that they studied the stars and had such a good mathematical construct of the heavens so many hundreds of years ago is pretty amazing. the sundial is so accurate!

Also, go there on a sunny day, when the sun is fairly high in... It's interesting for anyone, but very interesting if you understand the science involved. I didn't but there are guides available.  You can change cash here without the whole passport-photocopy routine. very scientific and it is amazing to see the accuracy of these 18th century instruments as you enter you see giant walls and you are unable to make anything out but if you hire a guide or a recorded version it becomes clear what the walls mean and what they depict
it is a proof the our Schoclors and Mathematicians... I would rate this as OK.

It has various astronomical instruments which have their own significance in calculation of time, day-night length and many other geographical as well as astronomical calculations.
Tourists visiting Jaipur must visit... Interesting and great inventions but it's really tooo.......hot for me to stand under the sun to study the theory behind....... Being my second time I understood the astronomical concepts in a clearer sense of the words. I also realized how astronomy plays an important role in the daily lives and religious beliefs of Indians .... and that's the reason I visited :) If you'r into observatories, astronomy and that kind of things, you should visit. Unfortunately, I am not, so.... By the way, I also visited   Jantar Mantar in Delhi (not far from Connaught Place) but the one in... Take a guide, and he will explain you the brilliance in the amazing brain of Maharaja Jai Singh II. I bet unless you are a mathematician and astonomer of the highest pedigree, you wouldn't understand even a bit of what is being told barring the... You could well walk into this large open-air space within the precincts of ( or adjacent to ) the City Palace ---- a question of conjecture since the Palace seems to blend imperceptibly with the rest of the city center ------ and conclude that what... excellent choice for watching, worth a visit.... astronomy is a science is well explianed...... The accuracy of the instruments is astounding although I must say i did not fully understand how they work.
The size impressed me . Lovely place with amazing views. If you are in Jaipur this with a few other tourist attractions is a must. I would recommend to friends and family! The whole experience was jaw dropping. Writing a description that Tripadvisor want, will take far too long to give it the justice it deserves... Just go and visit it!!! Great history behind this place
This place does not have a single spot of shade remember to bring water and some kind a shade so you can enjoy it !! Loved the structures, monuments and stunning size and intricacy of how the world used to tell the time and date! Go early to avoid crowds and school trips. The audio guide is a bit weird; if you feel like listening to a father tell his... We thought we had missed out on seeing Jantar Mantar in Delhi, not realising there was one in Jaipur too - we were told the Jaipur one is better. Loads of different time telling instruments and also some interesting astrological things too.

Very well looked... There are no such facilities in Europe, in India is icjh several built by a scientist, so only in India, Radjastan we can see and read of the 300 year old buildings to observe the sky of stars and planets The complex was excellent and our guide very informative. To think that the observatory was built in 1728 is incredible. A definite must see in Jaipur. The place looks great but it's very complex to understand.

I've some knowledge of Astronomy but after 5 min I was already lost.

The place is good but not at all for everyone.
If you have no interest in Astronomy, spend your time on something... Unusual Astronomic observatory. Spent 1hr here - again visuals are great - but best if they opened it at Night when it was meant to be used? Worth a go.... I took my children ages 7 and 10. You definitely need to hire a guide at the gate or you will have no idea what you are seeing. The  massive instruments can measure time of day, seasons, astrology. If your kids can understand rotation and... worth a visit for its uniqueness. Very well maintained site and is right across city palace, so you get to see two sights in one trip Jantar Mantar is a multimedia project and virtual museum about the astronomical observatories built in India during the early 1700's.  These observatories incorporate multiple buildings each with a specialized function for astronomical measurement. These beautiful structures with their interesting  geometric forms provide a rich insight... It was a superb exhibit but when you see it, and when you think about the science and construction involved rather than the astrology, then you will have to pinch yourself to take in that is was built starting in 1727!!! Great to see how things were done so well before the digital age. Great tour guide I had, Pradeep Singh was very knowledgeable.  I love how the Stars and Sun do not lie and are very precise as long as we have the tools to know how to read it.  This genius built a very remarkable and marvelous... Wanted to love this site. Love ancient astronomical instruments. But, most of these have been "" repaired"" so are not in original condition. Also, you cannot climb around them, so all the best views are blocked off.

Hot, with little shade. I overheard a few... Too bookish and probably would have better if we had employed a guide. Probably the govt or tourism dept provided a free guide to explain things. Otherwise well maintained place and too near the city palace that one can easily visit with the 5 monument... Beautifully laid out and maintained site. Extremely interesting but we stupidly didn't use a guide. Our advice-pay the few rupees to have someone explain how these fabulous things work. Buiklt in the 16th century it still looks futuristic even today. Sundial is accuate within 2 seconds Got to see to belive that such accurate measurements were possible in astronomy in those acient days! During a tour of India, we were told we were visiting an observatory (how boring, we thought ) What we didn't expect was the fascinating site which is Jantar Manar. It's an open-air site consisting of many structures which accurately give the date, time and... How amazing to see that these instruments were able to tell time and distance so accurately. Would have liked more time to look at each of the instruments but you really need to see this in the morning or late afternoon out of the heat... Excellent and very interesting! Never seen something like that before...followed the audio guide and was surprised by all that knowledge and calculations of time, stars, distances, etc! Well worth the visit, so much detail and huge. Take a hat and plenty of water it was very hot when we visited. We were fascinated by Jantar Mantar Observatory and  it was so interesting there were so many ways of telling the time by different types of geometric devices built in stone and marble..  It is fantastic you could read the stars and then there were horoscope... Well impressed with what we saw,  we had a guild to talk us round you do need this to explain what it all about. Worth buying the combined ticket to cover other attarctions A peaceful haven from the mayhem outside and a refreshing change from palaces, temples and forts. Worth at least an hour to explore. We photographed the information plaques alongside each instrument to keep as a record of its name and so we could read more... Just felt an awe visiting Jantar Mantar. For me its a must visit place in Jaipur. Not be missed. Its just fascinating. In Jantar Mantar, a certified guide is a must.  It will be easy to understand and a lot more interesting. If you understand what is Jantar mantar, you wil be amazed by its functioning, accuracy.... Pls make sure you visit with a guide, else it will be meaningless!!! It was nice to take the kids as they were able to learn alot about the observatory and the different instruments and what they were used for.  The intense heat was the only negative factor as one had to stand in the direct sun to... For those interested in astronomy this is a place you should visit. Ensure that you have a guide else you would not be able to appreciate the different instruments (large scale) on display. It's a World Heritage site. 
I would go to say that it's... If you are a science fan, then this is a must. One of the finest astronomical observatories. You will be amazed to find how accurate the sun dial clock is. It is certainly amazing to find how about a few centuries back the scientists could... Jantar Mantar was very interesting, but my boyfriend and I flew through it. If you're interested at all in astronomy/astrology though, you'll love this place! Astronomy is not something I felt was synonymous with India but this is a cool relic of the past. I had no idea Jai Singh was into astrology and this park is an artsy place to spend the day, although every structure being a different... if you are interested in astroloji,it is worth to visit but ,if you are not ,do not waste your time and money Jantar Mantar or Solar Observatory is an astronomical treasure house, with solar devices that give accurate predictions till date.  This building is found in Jaipur popularly known as Pink City the flamboyant and colorful capital of Rajasthan.  It is a must see wonder (one and... As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jantar Mantar is an incredible feat of humanity and a definite must see when visiting Jaipur. Very clean, quite peaceful place, extremely interesting place. if you like science then you will love this place as did my husband who loves that kind of thing. not suggested without guide. situated near city palce architecture , location and the monkeys. Very pretty setting out of the city. Lots of monkeys .........some can be aggressive........surrounding by rugged cliffs/hills The detail and skill with which the monuments were constructed is truly amazing. ""jantar mantar"" alongside with other monuments in india was beautiful for us and despite our shortage of time while being with tour,we run to see it because we didnt want to loose seeing any place.it was surprising and a very good museum of geometry and... We had a fantastic guide who explained how all the instruments in this amazing open air observatory worked.  It's worth having the guide.  This place includes the world's largest sundial, accurate to 2 seconds! Brilliant. To think that this level of acuracy has been aroung for so long is mind blowing. Well worth the visit Very interesting, but I bet some engineers or people who know about astronomy would totally love it. For a every person it's too much to understand but the structures are anyway beautiful. I just don't recommend it around midday as it's very hot and there's... The science behind the .. sun dials and the diversity of them are mesmerising. Well worth a visit and look at each piece carefully. Best done with the explanations of a local Jaipur tourist guide the observatory was very interesting well worth a visit This place is really amaizing. If you plan not to take a guide here then go for the MP3 players which is provided at a very resonable cost at the entry gates. Then you can simply put the ear phones and play the required track.... This is ok, if that sort of thing interests you. very clean area of Jaipur Very memorable. Interesting and unusually different from other Rajasthani palaces. good to visit with guide this place. interesting architecuture/instruments are there for calculating time/season in times when technology was almost non existing. Not to be missed, beautifully renovated and exquisite. The sundial (HUGE) works fine and you can see the shadow moving. Other instruments are more obscure but very impressive indeed. If you are interested in astronomy this may interest you otherwise you get bored by seeing those structures. Anyway you can appreciate ancient wisdom well maintained site, perfect place to see for visitors who are interested in astrology & science With a collection of numerous astronomical instruments, this place is an excellent example of the development of science in India almost 3 centuries back. This place is like a mystery for any person with all these majestic instruments. The best way to enjoy this place... Great place to learn about ancient age astronomy. The King who built this establishment was a genius one and has passion on astronomy. You need to hire a guide at the entrance to understand everything in detail. He will then explain about all the instruments,... Loads of random instruments used for astrology and timekeeping, quite interesting if only to see how much time and effort they put in to finding out exactly what the stars were doing for astrological purposes (rather than strictly scientific purposes) This large 18th century science projrect is amazing not just for the size and precision of the instruments but of their imaculate condition. There are five such parks for measuring atrology in India but this is the largest and best preserved. Beside the City Palace... A very interesting site and good central location. The observatory of the kings, is another architectural brilliance show casing the astronomical knowledge of the people at that time. It is still working accurately and leaves us in wonder how did the people at those times master the science. At first this looks like a modern sculpture park, but then with a little explanation it becomes obvious that people 200 years ago knew more than we give them credit for. The ticket desk had no change - as usual! Worth visiting to know how Indians were genius in Mathematical skills and their astronomical predictions,time counting.
Well maintained, don't miss Jantar Mantar whenever you are visiting Jaipur-India I had never heard of Jantar Mantar and was not recommended it by anyone before I got to Jaipur. We hired a guide for he City Palace who basically walked out the back door and suggested we go to this other place. I am so... i really like the way the have created those structures with the help of sun, moon and stars... brilliant stuff!! The amazing gadgets that the scientists came up with is mind boggling especially for their time!  We enjoyed the site, even though it was quite crowded. The journey was magnificent and fun filled. Jaipur is an amazing place to visit and must be seen again. This was absolutely fantastic.  Very clean and beautiful with the Amber Fort in the background, was just amazing. It's interesting to see these kind of things! I don't have any idea how do they worked! But it will be better if they put some catalog there for better understand the tools. One of Sawai Jai Singh's five observatories. This is probably the best preserved example of Indian astronomy.

Entry is included in the two-day composite ticket that includes Amber Fort, Hawa Mahal, Nahargarh Fort, and Albert Hall. Cost is 300 Rupees for Foreigners (about £3.90) and... it shows grate passion of Jai Singh to astronomy and astrology. Beautiful and spectacular instruments. Interesting site, especially if you are interested in astronomy or astrology. Better if you hire a guide that is good. I like the magnificence of the place. I am always intrigued to know how come so many years back people could design such ways and means to understand the planetary movements?? With the advancement of technology today, the gadgets at Jantar Mantar deserve a big... amazing set up, considering knowledge & technology that existed then. will recommend to all to view & absorb the details. I discovered this site by accident a year ago and could not wait to go there a second time. It's in the true meaning of the word: awesome. The audio guide though is worthless (the detailed descriptions of the various elements are too confusing). The... I am not sure but I think this is the worlds first proper observatory. The accuracy of the instruments build by engineers hundreds of years ago is mind boggling. This is marvellous.  A visitor to Jaipur has to visit this - only take a Guide without which you may not understand anything.  Good to see the level of science and the calculations being so accurate.  A must visit place. a very good place to visit, again camera is free so use it, also take a guide if u dont have knowladge about astronomy. its a world heritage site so please respect it. nothing special to dislike but a more detailed plaques would have been... In an excellent location near several other attractions, the Jantar Mantar is a World Heritage Site and a must for those who were told in history class of the great love and tradition that India holds for math and astronomy.  Some of the devices used... It's obviously an impassive place but I think one needs to be interested in astronomy or science to really enjoy it to the max. It is next door to city palace and it is freee if you buy the multi-ticket at the Amer Fort The Maharajah's Observatory is exquisitely beautiful, and will be interesting to everyone - not just science geeks Very interesting. Read some about it before you go there! Were a hat and be aware of the monkeys! Centrally located it gives you a great insight into the life and times of the rajputs and their wives. Don't miss it if you are in Jaipur. Invest in the pre recorded audio guide. It is worth it. Each has two sets of headphones so... The kids got board and so did we.  The science was interesting but it was not worth the effort. Jantar means""instrument"", and Mantar means ""formula"", or ""calculation"". So the name literally means 'calculation instrument'. Ancient Indian astronomers were also Jyotisa masters, so this is a religious site as well.This site has fourteen major geometric devices for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking current star locations... Its really great that they had constructed such instruments so long back and I was really surprised by the accuracy of the instruments. Going through them gave me a sense of pride. A must visit for everyone going to Jaipur. Its better to use the... This Jantar Mantar is leagues beyond the one in Delhi; well-kept, well-organized, and gorgeous on all counts. Also the largest of the Jantar Mantar structures, it has the most instruments and greatest variety of them. Only really interesting if you like science and the movements of the sun. Also you can see the whole of Jantar Mantar from the Palace The Jantar Mantar is the most amazing collecting of astronomical instruments and observatories built in the 1720s.  They are in excellent condition and some of them are several stories high.  Having a knowledgable guide would seriously enhance ones understanding of this UNESCO World Heritage site Give this Unesco World Heritage Site a visit when you are in Jaipur. I would recommend getting a guide or a booklet to help learn about the instruments and their function. It's amazing what people were able to invent so many years ago. I love the instruments, wow what thought was gone into building these.
I dislike the maintenance in spite of the fact that it is a world heritage site It's amazing that so long ago the Indians had developed such amazing systems ... but, perhaps it's only interesting, if you're into astrology. still it is worth going in to see how it must have felt to be a woman in those days, having too hide behind a facade always, away from the prying eye. get a guide and spend an hour learning about ancient precision astronomy.  i was amazed at the size of the astronomical instruments and their accuracy.  would be a bit boring if you're not into science or history. JANTAR MANTAR in the Pink City Jaipur is one of the best observatories in the world. the sun dial gives you exact time in all the seasons. it has been constructed on a very scientific basis. the most effective among all is Rama Yantra which... This requires only a short visit. I wouldn't bother with the guides. It is centrally located and near the other old city siights. to think that one man conceived of, designed and directed the construction of so many ingenious and beautiful instruments to measure celestial events...it boggles.
even if the concepts of meridians, elipticals, gnomons and the like go as far over your head as they do mine,... I went in hoping it would be a quick in and out but after going through it and seeing how accurate these instruments are, it was very glad to have come here. An observatory paralled by none other. A guide is a must to fully understand the working of the various instruments. a bright sunny day would be ideal to visit it. Like many places in Jaipur. This is a feast for the eyes Very few archaeological sites have been as well maintained by ASI as is Jantar Mantar Jaipur. One must visit it. However, the authorities concerned must pay attention to the chaos at the parking sites outside Jantar Mantar which are horrible, chaotic and spoil the spirit... I could not beleve when I saw how many ways there were to check either the time or the constellation of stars.   It is really like a picture of Dali as one of the other reviewers stated. I thought I was going to visit some sort of museum but was more astonished to discover that this open space had so very many instruments.  How time was told, how stars aligned, there is a symbol for every horoscope etc. I could not believe... it was really a world heritage site, time machine, zodiac sign, you can know a lot more things there about time and all An observatory that looks like a Dali painting. Great instruments to explore from the small to the very large. If you are a budding astronomer (or even a more accomplished one) then this place is a must see. 

Take a  guide to help explain all the different astronomical tools created here. Indeed I was suprised that this is still being maintained in Tip, Top shape. I did not see any chiiping, pai, damanged walls, flors etc,etc. One of the monuments thats in excellent shape in Jaipur. Learn how centuries ago time was calculated & the sun moon & stars were studied. Take a guide. the well designed structures
couldnt understand in detail It was amazing to see this the largest stone astronomical observatory in the world built by an Indian king.  While other kings were spending time pillaging and plundering, here is a king who was a master astronomer!  

A lay-man would not understand most of what... Awesome sundials and astrological calendars from the 18th century.  We had a lovely time here, and our 8-year old loved the whole place too (""It's the Stonehenge of India!!!""). It is all in such good order and ""working"". A good guide will explain each piece in turn. Another site to fit into your visit to Jaipur as it's pretty unique.  You certainly need an official guide to explain how all the structures work, but it's absolutely fascinating.  We got there in late afternoon when the colours and shadows are at their best. We went to Jaipur in December using a travel agent. We hired a government tour guide for the whole day. Having a guide HELPS. I would highly suggest it, you will get a lot more out of the city. Now, in our Lonely Planet guide... Great to learn about sundials and horoscopes.
Fascinating place It was amazing the technology that existed at the time, and the accuracy with which they were able to derive the things we now take for granted (like telling the time).  Absolutely amazing. Well preserved. Definitely worth a visit! Built by the founder of Jaipur,Maharaja Jai Singh,this astronomical observatory is a wonder.It is a haven for students,youngsters and astronomy/science enthusiasts alike.The audio guide is helpful and enriching.But if you are among the many who have no clue about maths,science or planets,and are not even... Very cool place.  We didn't go on a guided tour so I'm sure we didn't learn nearly as much as we could/should have, but it was neat nonetheless. Ask for a guide to explain the huge abstract constructions. Very interesting. 17th century : People could already predict the solar eclipse, the movements of the planets...and there is a huge clock. Very well preserved and maintained.  The audio guide was a bit too chatty for my taste, and seemed more aimed at children - but it still managed to give reasonable explanations of the purpose of most of the instruments. The observatory inlcudes the world's largest sundial, a huge edifice that is reputed to be extremely accurate. The many other attactions are fascinating: in India astrological charting was and remains highly important, and this remarkable observatory, very carefully constructed to provide as accurate information as... Jaipur is famous for both gastronomy, as well as astronomy. The
King Sawai Jai Singh (after whom the city gets its name) built
many astronomical structures (perhaps, at an astronomical cost,
too!) to satisfy his love for astronomy, and the heavenly bodies,
and accurate chronological... very intersting and unexpected attraction.We simply did not realize this was here to be honest ,private guide who showed us round was very good and so proud of his city If you are interested in astronomy, science you will be amazed. Unfortunately we were a little in the hurry visiting this but if you will have time it is worth to see. Amazin that people in old ages could measure time and other things with... This is great place for all the family to see, how did they do it you will be left asking each other. Relaxing to walk about at your leisure, our guide was very informative and if you can find one it worth the money for... Must see in Jaipur. Make sure you have a good guide who can explain the basic workings of a sun dial and other astronomican instruments. This was a totalluy unexpected surprise as the structure of the observatory appears very modern.  It was useful having a guide to explain the various exhibits, as it gave credence to their accuracy. Well worth a visit What a brilliant display of ingenuity and intelligence!  I loved this place with all it's innovative sculptures and instruments which gave us insight into what a wealth of knowledge and wisdom the Indians possessed many thousands of years before the U.S. even came into being. The Majaraja who created all this was really smart!
Worth to see how they calculate time, astrology etc just with the sun. you wonder how astronomy was so  accurate in those days It is the largest Sun Dial in India. World  heritage is involved in its care the place looks different and interesting but then when you do not have someone to help with what the hell these things were made up of its really is not so easy to enjoy and understand these structures , soem of them have stuff written... You need a guide to get the most from your visit.  Its a curious mixture of equipment and structures as ""discoverers' of the time sought to determine the laws of planetary motion Science precise before the age of computers and one really need to visit this huge laboratory of human knowledge of the universe. We were so tired after a whole day's shopping and sightseeing that we nearly skipped this one; I am so glad we didn't, although I might have gotten less out of it without our excellent guide's explanations. its an excellent place & the only functional Jantar Mantar. best is that when you look around, there is no view of any modern architecture, which makes it feel like it till stands in its time of its glorious past. Visit there if u r interested in astronomy and like to see sun/moon movements. good place if u r visiting jaipur. Take day tour bus, it will cover this in detail. I was not that keen on seeing 17th century astrology instruments, but rather visit the majestic palaces and forts... however, upon arrival, did not regret visiting this extremely well kept open air exhibit of at least 14 major astrological instruments in well groomed gardens. What... Even if you are not interested in astronomy, what we humans have been capable of in the past hits you in the face, amazing. An excellent site for scientific history, development of tools, observations, and so on.

But every guide we overheard (and our guide) were way into the astrology thing almost like it was a religion (maybe it technically is).  Lots of misinformation and mythology. The instruments are accurate and will fascinate you. Its all a play of shadows! Get a guide or the audio guides, else you wont understand the instruments. (Or atleast, stand next to a group with Guides!!) While I was there, male guides in Spanish was... Sounds boring - but far from being so.   Here you can see and have explained the mystery of this 300 year old Observatory - latitudes and longitudes    Methods have moved on but this place is definitely ""hands on"" for everyone - see the architecture of... Surprisingly interesting, and a nice break from the crazy streets of Jaipur. This became an unexpected highlight of the trip. This place was incredible. Huge structures that were made hundreds of years ago, but told the time correct to within a few seconds, today. The whole site is currently being tidied, but none of this distracts from the purpose of the structures. I wouldn't hesitate... Impossible to miss the giant Jantar Mantar. Guides are very helpful. It's like a please touch museum for history and astrology nerds Maharaja Singh must have had a brilliant mind to devise the Jantar Mantar (calculation instrument) in 1728. It is a huge observatory that calculates time by the place the sun's shadow falls on the huge sun dials. When visitors first see the observatory it seems... Lots of stuff to discover here so go with a guide..!! We all settled down their for d show around 6:20p.m on 14th dec2011 evening.It started off with a song which was actually very correlating  with the observatory.
The light and sound show at the Jantar Mantar as the monument itself is different from other historical... The World Heritage site of Jantar Mantar (Instrument of calculation) is the largest stone observatory in the world.  The Jaipur site is one of 5 (Delhi, Ujjain, Banaras, Mathura and of course Jaipur) all built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II.  This one was built... Not very good place to visit as there noting much to watch there. There is one very old watch system with which kings use to see the timings. In that if you are interested in physics then its fine otherwise I don’t think you should... though i stay in delhi...i never visited Jantar Mantar here.In Jaipur i visited this place of attraction with a guide who had a knowledge of astronomy and astrology.i must say it is a wonderful experience for me and my 6yrs old daughter also. A truly fascinating place. A must-see. Do hire a guide to understand the various instruments. It has a very different aspect to visit, just to calculate the activity of sun, moon, and star. very nicely built in old days. Awesome and unique (though I understand there are several others in Rajasthan.) A combination of scientific understanding, engineering ingenuity, and aesthetic desing.  Sometimes I thought I was looking at de Chirico paintings. it was amezing the clock in jantar mantar is still working you can check you clock with that See the giant sundial and the large one too, plus a device for measuring altitude and several astrological devices in a lovely courtyard setting. Very interesting - go with the kids!  Pleasantly surprised!! It did live up to the expectation after major disappointment at Jantar Mantar in Connaught Place, Delhi which has been desecrated with graffiti and scribblings. Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is a well maintained observatory and the grandest of the 5 build by the erstwhile maharaja... We spent about an hour here one afternoon and my husband was enthralled. He works in astronomy so it was personally relevent, but it was still interesting to me as well. i went there to see the worlds largest sun dial. hired an audio tour guide. was amazed at their knowledge that prevailed in the historical period. we have read there were many great scholars in our textbooks..on seeing jantar mantar i realized what makes them... The astronomical tools (?) are really cool; the audio guide (which is really cheesy and hilarious) tries to explain them as best it can.  Even if you're not a science / math - inclined person (I'm certainly not), it's still worth a visit! Jaipur's Jantar Mantar is a place which provides lot of learning about various astrological models in a more clear & precise manner which help lot of astrologers, researchers, architects etc. to understand basic concepts. Amazing place to go and see, old time how they determined time based on shadow of sun, it is amazing structures gives you knowledge of calculation and concept of math back than. It was an interesting site filled with huge instruments used in the 1700s to tell time, etc. I had a great time at the Jantar Mantar! After so many forts and palaces in Rajasthan, one tends to get a bit blase about yet another throne room and yet another armory. This is something completely different, fascinating and unlike anything I have ever... it was shocking how amazing this place is. God bless our ancestors. The place is worth visiting and at the first sight one may see some bizzare stuff around..But take a guide & go around & u would come amazed ....This is the largest & the best observtory...one should never miss.. We come out more dazed wondering... I liked it from a sculptural point of view but the astronomy stuff was a bit heavy for me. The audio tried to lighten it up but it ended up being a bit naff. It's sort of one of those places you have to go... Technology so advanced, so long ago. Needs to be visited with a guide, as, on their own, the instruments have no meaning. The structures are awesome with their astronomical accuracy But the complex needs better maintainance,more dustbins and need clean public toilets Needs more informative boards too Excellent preserved site - difficult to imagaine that it is so old. Jantar Mantar, which is next to the City Palace, Jaipur is an awesome mix of Ancient Science with modern Architecture. 

It was quite an experience to know how in olden days, the people used to follow the sun signs by merely mapping the movement of... Very interesting and there are plenty of explanatory signs around the site but think we would have benefitted from having a guide. We loved this place it was magical.  Well worth the trip. - even if you aren't scientific!  Again, try to get a guide to show you around, so much better experience.  Also bought a really good book fro the book shop. Heard it a a marvellous one but to be honest we could not understand except to appreciate that our forefathers had a great knowledge of astronomy. Amazing observatory in central Jaipur, very well restored and maintained.  Really interesting stone instruments far ahead of their time.  Worth a visit, great learning. Astronomical  observatory it's in  World Heritage List . Well thats all i can say This ancient observatory was one of the places which was recommended to me by friends and relatives and was well worth the visit. There are some very complicated explanations of the equipment used to identify locations of planets, but that didn't stop it being very... interesting to the inventions of past... and their relevance even in present day. It is indeed deserving of World Heritage site title... though needs to be maintained well. It was very interesting to see how time was seen before watches were discovered. The accuracy is amazing. The place is clean & well maintained. How could you expect that? To be seen, far better than palace! This is a must visit if you have any interest in astronomy or astrology. The place has the largest sundial in the world and several instruments to measure the angle of celestial objects to the axis of earth. Its amazing to see how one can... This observatory is so interesting and if you are into the zodiac signs you will truely love it. Amazing to thin that it was built between 1728 and 1734 and is still used to forcast the heat of summer monthsexpectd monsoons , floods and famine... It was impressive that this was created so long ago.  Kill two birds when you exit the palce, the entrance is right there. Looks like modern art!  Also very interesting as technology and history. Even if you are not scientifically inclined, a visit to the Jantar Mantar is worth it. It is just amazing to see sundials built hundreds of years ago which are accurate to 10 and 2 seconds. I was a little bit suspicious about this place but it is worth to see it. This is something different from the things that you can see in India. It is not another fort, palace or temple. It something that shows you part of science... This is a working observatory I am told and it was one of the most interesting places I have visited. We were showed how to read the local time based on the suns reflection. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II who built Jantar Mantar was a renowned Mathematician and Astronomer. His designs which took shape as the various monuments in the Jantar Mantar are awe inspiring to say the least. Take a learned Guide (Govt approved) (don't forget to check... It's a fascinating experience to be in place like this. It's a unique blend of high tech science and art. Undeniably it's displays the fine balance of precision, intricacy and hard work of Indian geniuses.Must see for every explorer. I'd agree with a number of comments here that note that Jantar Mantar can be a little obtuse if you're not fully fledged in science (and astronomy in general). But don't let that keep you away. It's a fascinating experience, even just on an aesthetic... I wasn't too sure that I would find this particularly interesting but I was pleasantly surprised.
If you go without a guide the whole experience will be pointless, as you will find yourself wandering around giant structures without any idea of their meaning.  However, if...

I was surprised to what a mervellous architechture india possess. It appeared to me very interesting. You need a guide to make the most of this site but once the guide explains what the instruments do and how they work it really is quite incredible. The Jantar Mantar site is very surreal, you cannot miss it if you are in Jaipur. It is so interesting to see what the love for astronomy led a king to build. Very well kept and filled with squirrels! Jantar Mantar has several astronomical instruments, which will keep you busy for more than one hour.
Maharaja Swai Jai Singh, who bulit this place was a great scholar, really ahead of its times, with great passion for stars and astrology. No wonder that it is... This is one not to miss site in Jaipur. I cannot imagine how they thought about all this at that time...truly innovative.

The sculptures and information inside the jantar mantar were fascinating, but to be honest I didn't... This is a must visit if you are in Jaipur. It makes you wonder the intelligence they had way back time. This complex of the Chandra Palace and the its astronomical observatory is another gem in Jaipur. With both Rajasthani and Mughal architecture, it is a wonder to see. The palace is huge and full of gates and gardens and all the trimming of imperial India....

The sundial complex is amazing and should not be missed. Our guide explained the accuracy of the sundials and those of us wearing watches were astounded that indeed, they are!!! To... This is a must-visit site.  Complex observatory built around 1728 - astonishing collection of  sundials, accurate down to 2 seconds, but also allowing identification of position of the constellations: fascinating! You don't have to be an astronomer to marvel at these structures.  It would have been interesting to actually see them work. Old astronomical site looks like a Dali landscape -- great for photos, near other old city sights. We personally didn't enjoy this observatory, however it was very busy when we visited and many people seemed to like it. The signs/descriptions were quite difficult to understand (perhaps our lack of knowledge in all matters astronomy!). Science way back when.....loved the sundial and how accurate it was. Jantar Mantar is located in the heart of the old town called the 'Pink City'.

It might... Completely disgusting. Filthy. Heaps of clothes and rags and garbage in different corners. The building and it's location could be quite attractive if the filth would be dealt with. I also expected more monkeys. Awesome place to come and watch the monkeys. Nice temple, although run down it’s still very beautiful. Be sure to book a return Tuk Tuk as Uber’s kept cancelling on us and we ended up having to pay a much higher fee. Wonderful place to spend time with family and friends.

I am not sure this is here to give the monkey's a safe place to live or for the people there to... Multiple temples to look at at Galta Ji. Cows, dogs, monkeys (opposing gangs from either side of the valley) abound. Walking up to the pools is an adventure. It’s narrow, there is barbed wire and monkeys on all sides.

There are obviously lots of monkeys and they seem quite tame-
You do get hasseled to go in... Lots of apes but buildings tatty and lots of rubbish with water covered in green algi not the most pleasant venue. Great temple set on the outskirts of Jaipur, monkeys running around while devotees, bath and shower in the waters, historic buildings surrounded by the soaring hills, very beautiful. Temple is in the lap of small hill. It is very old. The paintings on the outside wall are nice but faint. Many monkeys are three. People feed they so much that they leave the food. Bad smell due to leftover bananas, nuts and other... This place was like stepping back in time into the jungle book ! What a fascinating place that made our Jaipur trip ! It’s not like anything else in the world . A true mystical hidden gem ! We spent around an hour here recently.

The monkeys make it fun - they are all over the place.  Bring some treats for them if you can.  Would recommend... A run down area full of rubbish and mangy looking monkeys. If you are that desperate for a picture of a monkey then go there. If not go anywhere else.

There is the ever famous monkey man, an avid wildlife... This place is a must see. There is a small fee to get into the temple which is basically towards the upkeep and very cheap. If you go at the top and behind the building there are some grey and white monkeys too. The monkeys... If you like monkeys then this is worth a visit.

It’s nickname is the Monkey Temple but there were very few monkeys when we were there.  The entrance is litter... Easily accessible by tuk tuk  from Jaipur the Monkey Temple is worth a visit. Don't expect it to be clean and tidy but the buildings and monkeys are good to look at. Use a guide, he might get the monkeys to sit on you if... we went to this place in a rush before our flight.

I liked it because I like animals. There was dirty and it's not proper for children.  Monkeys are around you and it will be wonderful if you like them! Run down dirty dump of a place.

It's a complete dump and the only thing worth seeing are the monkeys which were well feed and didn't need any extra from you. Only... What a place!

Before we knew it one ‘guide’ had taken my nuts and was trying to get a monkey on my shoulder (even though we insisted not to) he then obviously wanted... We had a previously bad experience with monkeys in Cambodia but here it was great! No need for a guide, they will tell you that you need one because the monkeys ""know them"". This is of course, Not true. as most public places in India: great cultural experience, poor hygiene experience... bizarre flee market at the entrance to the temple, there was a cow with 6 legs. After riding all the way out from the main city, I reached Galtaji Temple. The monkey temple was amazing. It's full of monkeys (they didn't trouble me as such). The priests and the staff are more than happy to share the history of this temple. Galtaji Is a Peace of Mind Very Very Good Place..Very Much Monkeys are hear.Out of

We decided to visit this temple as we had extra time with our driver. Upon arrival, we paid our entrance fee to the monk and walked past a cow field and then through a turnstile into what looked like a monastery. Just beyond that there... The old buildings are amazing.

If you are expecting sanitised pathways and rose scented accommodation then this is not for you.
However, if you want authenticity, a real local experience and something truly unique, then get yourself to the monkey temple!
Yes it's a bit smelly... that's monkeys for you...100s... A holy place situated on Aravali hills. It is a very dirty and smelly place because of too much monkeys. The site itself was very interesting being built in a narrow valley and ascending through a number of steps and buildings and passing a series of pools to the spring. The water coming into the top pool was crystal clear but the lower pools, including... Not worth the drive. Dirty place with lots of derelict buildings and aggressive monkeys. Lot of scams being run also. Much more interesting things to see in Jaipur than this place This place is awful. Smelly stagnant water with pigeon and monkey poo everywhere.  Nothing of great interest unless you like monkeys and dirty old temples. We couldn't get out of there quick enough. Yuk!! In reading the other reviews, I think hiring one of the guys down at the bottom would have been smarter since I walked up to the monkey temple alone and really didn't get to interact with many monkeys!  (I think they were sleeping in the... This Monkey Temple is in the way from Agra to Jaipur. Even having low time to visit around is worthy to stop and visit it.

Monkeys are staving but behave peacefully. The entrance is for free. The views are good and is surrounded by very... The monkey temple was so much fun and I think the best part of Jaipur. There's really no entrance fee, but you have to pay 50rupee for each camera. You will also need a monkey guide. I say need because they know exactly how to... I would've given this a 5 out of 5 rating. The smells & the mess are all part of India so I was ok with that.
The place in my opinion is stunning.
The problem is the helpers & the monks there are all touts.... Most drivers will take you to the front which means you have to climb a hill to a temple and great views at the top. Then you have to down the other side to the real temple and baths and holy men.
Meaning if course... We had a two day tour of Jaipur and guide recommended we add this to our itinerary. Exceeded all expectations. So much fun to feed monkey's. Bring lots of bananas and other fruits with you.... you won't be disappointed A surreal, wonderful place. It seems to be on a movie set, with monkeys everywhere. Together with the Taj Mahal, this is the best thing I've seen in India. A must in this fantastic country.
We made the tour with a very special local guide who even entered a BBC program. A true ambassador of Indian culture and that transported us to another civilization. A magical place essentially used by believers and with very... Filthy hike up the mountain. Loads of trash and animal feces on the road (more than normal). Temple was under construction when we went, so no monkeys because of the noise. What a place! It is semi-abandoned, quite dirty and the buildings need a proper refurbishment. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed visiting it- to us, it seemed to be a microcosom of India, brimming with contradictions: a new and colourful tower next to a big and derilict... The monkeys here for the most part are very friendly. They may climb on you to get food so only carry small amounts in hand at a time. Peanuts are sold outside the temple and right before the entrance. You will typically be asked for... Well it is intrensting place to visits but you have to prepare for dirt, smell of trash and excrements in the not so well kept buildings. And monks gonna ask for money.

Nd jal mahal is really looking amazing in the evening nd i really enjoyed in jaipur Yesterday we visited the Monkey Temple.  I was  a bit reluctant as it was the end of the day and we were both very tired from traveling.  Who would know that seeing a bunch of monkeys could be so moving.  Our guide, The Monkey Man... great spot for photos and to feed monkeys they are very friendly  and  will  eat  from your  hands,  make  sure youbpick up skins once finshed or you will get told off Visited the monkey temple paid to go in and with all the building work going on there were no monkeys to be seen!

Beautiful nature, authentic, scenic, relaxing area. I loved watching the monkeys...a must! Galta ji is a major tourist attraction of the Jaipur.  Points of interests & landmarks.

From Chandpole gate, if you walk on a straight road for about 6 kilometers, you start climbing on stairs leading you to top of the hill to this Temple. On other side of the hill, there are water... Monkeys, temple and views very entertaining. Lots of beggers going up and down. Dodgy guys at top of temple requesting Rs50 for one to be alowed to take photos, this should be free. Dodgy tuk tuk drivers demanding high Rs100 tariff to go down temple. We had a guide for this temple and really it is a short visit. They are desperate for you to have photos with the monkeys, and you get to see that the women wash seperately to the men, but as the men are gawping at... It's a temple. There are monkeys.  So that's cool,  but it's a holy place and it feels really awkward to be the tourist walking around and taking pictures while people are there to worship.  People sell food to give the monkeys.  No entry fee, a... Part of the 4 day tour of the Golden Triangle. A very good tour, with good guides and a great driver. Recommend it to my friends We visited late afternoon; it was very busy as there was a special festival and pilgrimage occurring.
Our driver dropped us about 10 minutes walk from the entry area as parking was full. We paid 50 rupees as a camera fee; there is definitely no... There are two ways to reach monkey temple. One is a long walk from entrance at the market area. And another by vehicle upto the temple.choose the second option  bcoz walkway is very dirty. This place is very poorly maintained. There are many many monkeys... This is a beautiful place, not built up and commercialised like a lot of other tourist attractions around India and Asia. 
Great location with some wonderful temples and friendly priests, a very fulfilling experience. The views are beautiful in the hills. 
Seeing wild macaques and... Climbing those stairs and viewing the Ganesh Temple are much more fulfilling than feeding peanuts and bananas to those poor, exploited monkeys. I went there with my girlfriend expecting a bad experience, but it was a really good experience with the monkeys jumping and swimming in the water, and people swimming in the pond, we really had good time.
Highly recommended. This place was hilarious! The building isn't very special but when you spot all of the monkeys, it comes to life! They WILL grab stuff from you if you're holding food so beware. And it's not just monkeys... it's India - there are cows, goats,... After reading the reviews I did not want to visit Galta Ji but my husband really wanted.

I thought it was better than expected. Yes its dirty, smelly and there are lots of monkey, dogs, cows and pigeons.
But also the sight is very picturesque... The place where there are lot of monkeys are to be seen and they site besides and eat food. Their is also a pond or we can say (kund) where many people come to bath and enjoy. Their is some religion for bathing in galta... Nothing interesting.
According to me most of the people come here just for the name of the place: so exotic also for me ...
But at the end nothing beautiful to see Heritage temples, caves and holy pond. Gives an excellent experience of ancient India and Architecture in Rajasthan. Wonderful old temple complex in a rugged setting in the mountains.  Terraced pools for ritual bathing.  Interesting architecture.  Charming monkeys! Why is this to-do so low on the list? We were here for 3 hours and just had a blast the whole time. It's amazing to interact with monkey. Simply fascinating. We held and had numerous monkeys on us with no problems. Bring some peanuts.... the place is amazing! the building are ancient and very interesting. the place is hidden between the mountains and the road is great. the experience with the monkeys was friendly and funny Feeding monkies is very funny experience, just be carefull, don't touch them and wash your hands after 😉 We arrived after a long trip from Agra and made it to the Temple just before sunset.  Barely a soul in the place. Made it very eerie.  Like something out of an Indiana Jones movie.  Even the ride to the Temple is cool. Passing through... Unfortunately, the site is a nest of fake 'guides', hawkers and beggars. Large groups of men hound visitors in a shameful attempt to extort money. This is even made even more disgraceful, given the religious significance of the temple. We were followed for almost 1km... Beautiful temple up in the mountain away from flat Jaipur city (not a far drive). Filled with monkeys so DON'T BRING FOOD and be cautious holding anything you don't want stolen. They're are known to snatch things if you have something they want. Overall a... We visited in September.  I can't say that I was wowed by it.  It's pretty, but not worth going to, in my option.  We missed Albert Hall for it, which I would not do again. It's off the beaten path, not clean by any means,... I love it, but won't give a 5 star because it's not fair that you have to pay an entry fee depending on your face, it's a temple and should be opened to everyone!! I went with some 'white' friends and we had to pay... Yes, this place is dirty, as every review here notes.  However, I'd still strongly recommend it.  First, it is fairly undiscovered and, thus, not nearly as crowded as other India tourist sites.  Secondly, feeding the monkeys is just plain fun - the monkeys are not... Built within a mountain pass within the Aravalli Hills 10 km. east of Jaipur, Galtaji has been a retreat for Hindu ascetics belonging to vaishnavite Ramanandi sect, since the early 16th century; its present temple was built by Diwan Rao Kriparam, a courtier of Sawai... this is must see place in jaipur. it is very old temple. This place is very poorly maintained. but you should here once. It was a very special temple where you can play and fed a lot of monkeys freely enjoying the forest or the pools inside the temple. It is not so famous in Jaipur Paid a guide with intimate knowledge of resident monkeys....nice  interaction with them without fear. 
Priests and families live on temple grounds, friendly and happy to let you see most areas..small tips 10Rs each appreciated. Great architecture plenty of monkeys, but very dirty even by Indian standards. Was good to look at but only because it was on the way. Would not make a special trip, plenty of other great things to do in Jaipur. Well worth the long walk uphill to temple 
Use a local guide
Look for the snake charmer at the beginning of the walk but dont stop as will cost money There is no place in the US like this place.

The temple of hanuman have a very good view of building for 500-1000yrs of history but not well maintain. The sanitation is not good but it is believe the water on top is holy water, thus indians will go and have a shower there. The Monkey Temple is excellent and an absolute must if you visit Jaipur. Just make sure to go in with a Monkey Master (guide) to show you around. The road up to the temple is really surprising as there are many wild peacocks. The temple is left as it was so many years back and this is what we loved. Do not be afraid of the monkeys they are good, but do not... Ok let's start with the negative.

A man approaches you. 
He tells you that the bag of nuts in your hand has made you the subject of attention to the horde of... This is a beautiful excluded temple outside Jaipur full of monkeys - be careful, they are not scared!

Check with locals the best time to visit. I went on a day where there was a local festival going on and it was spectacular!! Located on hill top. 10 minutes of walk but view is great from top. You can see entire Jaipur city from there. Galta Temple is also known as Monkey Temple.

Besides I was charged... money temple is great place and feeding  food for monkey also here are monkeys in swimming in a pool also An interesting place and I did like seeing the monkeys, but I would not recommend a visit. It is a shame, because the temple is situated in a pleasant canyon, but I fear that the only reason the monkeys are there is because they feed... It's overwhelming at first at the amount of wildlife that is present: Monkeys, Cows, Pigs, and Dogs are literally everywhere.

Thought this would be over hyped and touristy not a bit of it. An awesome place set in a mountain cliff, we took a local guide who know how to handle the monkeys who were tame and sat on your head. A really worthwhile trip. This temple is situated in jaipur got it names because of the presence of thousands of monkey around it. Worth watching once. Start by driving around (east side) so that you can walk through and exit into Jaipur. Nice village with monkeys, followed by hike with incredible view over mountains and Jaipur. Went to the temple just before sunset x the view over Jaipur is stunning. Fair walk to the temple on uneven ground. All the monkeys were at the bottom so no need to walk to the top if you only want to see the monkeys.... I went to Galtaji in Feb 2017. It is extremely poorly maintained. There were some small houses inside the temple premises. The place was crumbling, there was trash everywhere and because of the monkeys and the pigeons, it stank terribly. 
The waterbody inside was dirty... I was a bit nervous about visiting Galta-Ji, as previous reviews here on TA had pointed to aggressive monkeys. But we decided to be brave but sensible (keep our distance etc)
August is quiet for the monkeys, so better for a nervous traveller!
The camera... We were accosted by a friendly young man on arrival who advised us that it would be sensible to have a guide to take us around particularly with the monkeys. He was right...and reluctantly we accepted his offer. He was brilliant, helped us feed the... One of stops was to see the monkey temple in jaipur, it's an experience, some good and some bad. The temple is very dirty with flies everywhere, mainly because the monkeys are fed bananas and the peels are left everywhere. You can buy some nuts... While I can admit that this experience was certainly an experience, I would not recommend it. The only highlight was the monkeys jumping in the water, otherwise it felt as though the religious significance was the only reason to visit, rather than as a tourist... It is not worth the gas going there..
Dirty pools full of monkeys, everything is almost in ruin.
Jain priests try to invite you the temples.. that are nothing special. The site itself is quite dirty, however the monkeys are harmless and can been seen jumping off the temple into the fountain. 

We approached from the bottom of MI road so ended up going to sun temple first with views over jaipur. 

To get to... It is a very old temple with high cultural and Heritage importance. Galta ji has lots of monkeys, be sure not to harm them. Long walk and a bit hidden but worth the trek. We accidentally went to a different temple first (I think it was the sun temple), but it was a nice surprise. 

Don't forget to feed the monkeys on the path to the temple. Loved feeding... The actual temple isn't impressive, it's very small and badly looked after - but oh my gosh the walk was such fun. Monkeys are everywhere on the sweaty walk up, they run across your path and you can get quite close, even to the babies.... Galta Ji was one of the biggest surprises for me in Jaipur. I went there in the end of the day (arrived around 5:30 PM) and started exploring the place as sunset started to take place.

I was impressed with the buildings and how beautiful... I'm a bit scared of monkeys so it was a bit of a challenge but I found it easier with a bag of food so they would take it and leave. The atmosphere of the place is amazing, it feels like a set out of... It's too hot in May to do the walk over the hills, so a 30 min drive through Jaipur's southern suburbs and then countryside is very nice. Temple itself is built in to Valley and is overrun with Monkeys. The big pond half way up...

It's a small temple with some amazing views of Jaipur and we... One of the favourite places I visited while in India. Beautiful buildings, although sad to see they have not been looked after.

Expect a fair walk but you'll be rewarded at the top by how much... Galta ji is situated in the middle of the mountain. We felt very peace of mind & enjoy there continues singing. Words to describe this place are somewhat difficult to find. Whilst the setting is that of a largely disused temple parts of it resemble a film set from one of the Indiana Jones movies. A steep walk to the top has the additional attraction of... It is a big complex with 3/4 temples and a couple of ponds. You get a taste of Rajasthani architecture and murals, and see the monkeys frolicking in the sun. 
From the Galta ji complex, we trekked up to the sun temple, which is a...

This is a very small temple where you could have a complete view of Jaipur City.

You'll need to walk up trough a small mountain with many many monkeys.

Monkey Temple where the revered monkey gods inhabited 4 temples. Climbed to top of the hill alongside the water fall. Segregated bathing pools for each gender. Used mainly for festivals. The monkeys from Jaipur are brought here for them to live in the ruins This is  a popular site for area and rightly so. A tour guide is not necessary unless you are traveling alone as I was and wanted someone to take photo's for me, which my guide was very good at. The long hike up is well... There is no big temple or anything here. There is a big pond among the hills where the monkeys use as a source of water. It is just an added place by the tour operators. Nothing much expect for the huge number of monkeys. We... If you are travelling with young kids there is a long distance to walk and then to climb a lot of stairs to reach the temple. Go there only to feed the monkeys they will come and take the food from your hand. Kids will... A must place to visit while in Jaipur ! Had the Monkey Whisperer as our guide . Very informative , friendly , helpful ...took some great photos for me ..
He talks to the monkeys & keeps them calm ....
It's a place where people... There is nothing like Monkey Temple in Jaipur. This name is popular only among tourist guides and they introduce the pilgrimage place of Galta as Monkey Temple since foreign tourists are not attracted by religious significance of Galta pond or temples. There is not a... We came here, did not have a clue what quite we were going to see..
Its a long walk up the hill, and back down the other side to the temple.. (on a hot hot day in May this was quite tough).

Once you get... The entire ""attraction"" is basically deserted and very sketchy. Filled with too many monkeys and some oddball characters doing who knows what, the road up is quite long and it's not impressive when you make it up. I was a solo female traveler and while... great place to be at if you want to leave the busy lives aside ! superb architecture surrounded by amazingly peaceful hills gives  a surprisingly energetic vibe! 

Said to be one of the most auspicious ponds in india, as even after many research no one... Buy some food for the monkeys and feed them! Very nice feeling! And the view is amazing..
Be careful with the food.. Monkeys will try to steal it! This is not a tourist site, per say but it is well worth a visit. If you are interested in the Hindu religion and the monkey god, Hanuman its educational and amazing as they relate to the monkeys who freely roam the temple at the... Nice place in a little rocky gully with natural spring .
Every one seemed to want money for something (or nothing ) paid entrance fee then the guy wanted a tip as well  not even for guiding 0 then guru type sitting baching a pot... Money Temple is all that it name suggests. We brought peanuts from outside and kept the paper bag inside our pockets and just a few peanuts in hands. The monkeys didn't attack us but approached us, as we handed out the peanuts,they took it and... There were not that many people when we visited and also not that many monkey's.  the few that were around was playing.  The temple itself I loved. I loved Jaipur and all of the forts, palaces and sights.  Galta Ji was absolutely my favourite among them, and I would recommend that every visitor to the region puts this on their itinerary. This is an active temple, so on Sunday, hundreds of local... Getting to see the monkeys up close is very cool, although these ones certainly know how to exploit the tourists by getting food from you and remember these are monkeys and do not care about hurting you. Be aware of the people trying to scam... The Monkey Temple was my favorite thing in Jaipur and most memorable stop in my India trip. There are free-range monkeys everywhere that are so neat to go up and walk with. Be aware of people trying to give you a private tour, if you... located roughly 20 km from city it is considered as a holy shrine has 2 kunds or water reservoirs for holy dip one for ladies n one for men. mythologically it is said that water from the ganges river fills these reservoirs through a 'gau...

Yes, it is small (3 levels to get to the monkey pool and temple area) and... Our kids (13 and 14) said this was the best place of our whole trip to Rajasthan. They enjoyed playing and feeling the monkeys. It is indeed a good distraction outside of Jaipur. This place is not (yet) that touristic. Local people come here to pray, bath and feed the monkeys on certain days. The monkeys are not really aggressive. In fact, they are much nicer than the ones in Taj Mahal. But if you want to feed... This place is simply enchanting. Built in the middle of the rocks, reminded me of many movies (Indiana Jones, The jungle book, ...). I felt like being in a place totally out of time. The monkeys were pure fun. I think this mystical place is... Our visit to this temple is one that will last our family a lifetime.  It is a photographic dream a gorgeous temple nestled into the side of a mountain, 360 degree views of beauty surround you.   But, the stars of the temple are the troops... We visited this place on the way to jaipur.  Our driver was friendly enough to buy lots of bananas on the way.  Me and my boyfriend were worried about the monkeys so we did not take the bananas in our hands and asked our driver...

Nice place with many monkeys. Sometimes they can be aggresive so be sure to have good shoes and to don't be too close to them when you give them food. You can get a guide or buy food at the start of the road.
Also,... I read some reviews where people complained that the monkey snatched the bag of food they bought or became aggressive. So we skipped buying food for the monkeys. The monkeys were adorable and never bothered us in the least. The lounged or they played, oblivious... Really nice place to see....everyone tries to get money off you. Security will try to charge you 50 rupees at the entrance to use a camera... don't pay- nobody is policing it once you get inside. You can get some really nice photos there. You... We visited  this temple only after we had exhausted all the other tourist attractions in Jaipur. A glitch in our trip  to Rajasthan kept us in Jaipur for a few more unexpected nights. Our driver, Rakesh, mentioned that we should visit the Monkey Temple. I... India is the land of nice people. One of the great example was my visit to monkey temple called galta ji where people gave food to the monkeys and the monkeys came near to the people once they showed banana to them and take it... A place with lots and lots of monkeys. Various temples showcasing different deities are also present. One has to walk all the way from the entrance to a short uphill path that pass through a few temples. Nice place to click pictures and visit a... This is a great way to spend some time here, the admission is really cheap and there's plenty to do. Please ensure that you are able to walk without assistance as there are many steps. The scenery is spectacular and worth the visit. There is nothing to see as a temple. Just some dirty ruins and crazy monkeys. I think that doesn't worth to visit it. There is no charge to visit it. It may be some people asking for money. You MUST find the monkey whisperer man. He's amazing. He talks to the monkeys it's insane! 

He gets them to sit on your head and your shoulder. Totally not aggressive monkeys he soothes them. 

A baby monkey ate a peanut from out of my hand!... We went to the monkey temple from the front side and walked around 30-40mins to monkey temple. The temple supposed not to charge but one guy requested to charge ""camera fee"" as we bring camera. 
To go to the monkey temple, there is another entrance...

If you do then you need to do 2 things. 

1) Get your taxi driver to contact the 'monkey trainer/whisperer' a local guy with long hair who has done work with national geographic. He is a local 'volunteer' guide and will show you around for... First thought when I saw the temple: Stephen King must've found his inspiration for the jungle book in this temple! Remember the scene with Mowgli and all the dancing monkeys?! At this temple you will find a lot of monkeys, just walking next to you!... On the drive from Agra to Jaipur, we asked our driver to make the short side trip to Galta.  Along a narrow, bumpy road through a picturesque canyon we approached the end of the road location for the entrance to the Monkey temple.  Monkeys, cattle,... We arrived late afternoon. The place was deserted with only one monkey. There is no entry fee but we paid Rs50/camera. The view was just okay from the top. Go if you have free time and transport as it was quite a drive up the... Do not go here. I was so disappointed and really did not enjoy the experience. It is so dirty and polluted. It ruined my first impression of Jaipur and I wish I had not gone. Amazing  monkey temple .You pay a small entrance fee and then can move freely in the temple . Not a few monkeys but not as wild as they always say . magnificent view of the place . I was glad to have been there the... We really enjoyed to visiting monkeys temple. .it is a friendly  monkeys temple. .. but don't forgot to give banana  to monkeys. .....
Love  it. We went in the evening around 6 pm or so. We walked up to the temple through poop and among monkeys that did not look friendly. I remember reading the review about the ""pesky creatures"" and thought ""the lady was right!"". As a matter of... This is a remote place and you will require a tuc-tuc to  get there, If you feed the monkeys they do behave well - the place itself is DIRTY even for India, which has some charm too.. The temple is small and the atmosphere is... It's a bit of a hike to see the entire temple (especially during the hot summer months). Well worth it though to explore the grounds and see all the monkeys! There is a pool that the locals swim in, and you can buy peanuts to... I feel my self fun by surrounding by friendly monkeys and some of them are need to be aware of them. 
Temple have surprise quantity of monkeys temple also have great look over the wall great place to visit. Today we visited the Monkey Temple in Jaipur. We nearly didn't bother but so glad we went. The landscape is spectacular, the temple itself in semi ruins but so wonderfully Indian. It was quiet as far as ""attractions"" go so that was nice. The different... The monkeys are cute but they all seem sick... plus there are weird mutant cows at the entrance. Good place to see the sun set. You will need to climb a steep, winding path to reach this temple, but it is worth the trek. Once at the top, you will have great views of the pink city, but the temple itself doesn't offer much in the way of anything spectacular.... I really enjoyed visiting the monkey temple in Jaipur. It's a cool place to explore, and I love watching the monkeys and how they interact with each other. I had the chance to have them jump up on my shoulders, it was lots of fun.... Been to this temple with family. Temple carries the history of the hinduism. This is more local place than a touristic one, so if you are coming for tourism, you can enjoy more the monkey activities. Can feed the monkey and take pictures with them... We spent about 2 hours at this place. Really lovely place. Great way to spend sometimes. Worth Visit! The visit to Galta's sacred tanks where the monkeys can be found was well prepared.On our journey from Jaipur to Agra we stopped here and in order to have enough time for the visit we left Jaipur a bit earlier than usual.It was a good... A 15 min walk. A dirty place. There are monks who want to rip you off and get paid for their prayers. Lots of poor people around and full of monkeys, cows, dogs. This place has plenty of monkeys and no shortage of great and helpful students willing to guide you along your way so armed with some peanuts, we headed off and were mobbed by monkeys posing very well for great photos and they were very well... When we visited, we were the only foreigners/tourists here. The street leading up to the temple was filled with pigs, feces, and more monkeys than we were comfortable with. Before parking, our tuk tuk driver told us when we arrive a guy will offer his... this was such an incredible experience. I felt like indian jones walking up the monkey temple! I was able to take such amazing photos too with the monkeys walking around the city in the background! You really have to do this ! I would of... I wanted to go to monkey temple but we were told it was closed, the guide was very reluctant to take us there, but at the end he agreed. On the way there you can actually see the Indian slams (just see from the car),... Located between rocks of a rocky valley, Galta is a lonely place that entwines with nostalgic feelings. It is also known as Hanuman Temple. There you will meet hundreds of monkeys, arrogant and aggressive macaques and more welcoming and tolerable langurs. You can buy peanuts... There is quite a walk from the bottom where the tuktuk takes you to the top, so just be aware of that, especially if it is as hot and sunny as it was when I went. There are a few reasons I am rating this... Its not a far ride from jaipur, easy to reach with car. Its an interesting place where a lot of monkeys are being fed by locals. The monkeys are very interested in what you have to offer them and like to eat from your hand.... But totally worth it.  The drive to the foot of the hill and the walk up with monkeys, pigs, goats, cattle and people was well worth it. Took a tuck tuck which although remote and not really on the main Jaipur tourist route, was very pleasant and we stopped off at the Sisodia Rani Bag (not worth a journey in its own right).  Despite my respect for monkeys which in my experience... Maybe not every ones cup of tea but I loved this place. Spent 2hrs here, wandering while interacting with and feeding the monkeys. Living in a country that has no wild life, I enjoy this type of experience. The monkeys were very gentle, appearing not... The temple is up the small hill, so you have to walk about 15 - 25 minutes. There are lots of monkey on the road up, but in my opinion they are not dangerous. Maybe the old ones a little. I gave some peanuts to... We arrived in time to watch sunset. It's a real non tourist spot. Relaxed wander up the cobbled meandering track amongst monkeys, dogs, goats and pigs. Put your shoes in the alcove and shut the door when you get to the temple to ensure the... It doesn't worth at all: dirty, careless, naughty monkeys, stray dogs, poor people... There are many things to do and to see in Jaipur much more better than visit this abandon city We arrived later in the afternoon so we missed the main monkey activity inside the centre so I would recommend to start noon or before. It takes 30 to 40 minutes to walk all the way in. The entire walk is very exciting with wonderful... Wow, is this place underrated. Because it's out of the top 20 on TA, we only went there by chance when a taxi driver said it was a must see. Amazing place to feed and play with monkeys or cobras. Strolling up the gorge on... As a westerner when I was dropped off by my driver in the carpark & I was immediately approached by local villagers wanting to act as my guide or peddle me their wares. Ignoring first instincts I selected a ""rough looking guy"" to be my... Don't waste your time. Filthy, smells like s..t everywhere. Go somewhere else....
There are a lot of people who are trying to sell you something.
It's a petty actually. If they would take care of the place this could be great. This is free, relatively quiet and understated. Some amazing but neglected buildings. Good to see locals here and no peddlars. I would never have found this but our amazing guide and driver, Ankit from  ' discover India by car'  took us here. Worth a visit. My friend and I stayed in Jaipur for 3 days and we were very lucky to have met and have a new friend-our Tuktuk driver named Lucky. He was with us for 3 days and this is one of the places he have showed us.... This place is filthy & gross & filled with beggars & no monkeys (OK, a view of 2 monkeys far away up a hillside). We saw many more monkeys in much better surroundings on the way into the Taj Mahal and on Elephanta Island in... On arrival you almost have to fight your way through people trying to sell you stuff. Here is where Reading the national cricketnews worked like a charm: they changed from pushy people into the most friendly guys. Explaining us that cricket is a religiën here.... This temple is not well kept and as far as Indian temples go it's one of the least impressive. As for the monkeys, the constant feeding has taught them bad habits and they are more of a pest than they add to a ""spiritual experience"".... On arrival "" Theres a 1000 monkeys inside"" said the ""ticket man"" quickly followed by ""donation please"". Please be aware that this is a free entry temple and any ""donations"" go straight in the ""ticketmans"" pocket, there is no ticketman here. However, like alot of... Again a unique one where you will feel whether Moneys are worshipped or a God/goddess and it is a thrill to see the place. We got here at 7:30 am, and were the only tourists in the area. We bought a bag of peanuts before starting the walk up. There were people living on the sidewalks the entire way up. They were just waking up as we got there.... There are a lot of negative reviews about this place being dirty, etc.. and I guess that's true.  Really, it's an old temple ruin in the hills, overrun by monkeys, but that's the whole point.  I was there with my wife and two small children... Such a shame, this place could be magical if it was cared for but there's litter everywhere, the monkeys can bite so beware, and tour guides are out to get you. If you enter the temple you might be asked to make a donation so... Worth a visit but be prepared for a bit of a hike to the temple at the top  -  well worth the effort though as the view is amazing.  The 'spa' on the way up is a bit of an eye opener and I declined... We would personally suggest that by avoiding this nothing must will be lost.  May be you can spend the time elsewhere. It seems odd to call a temple an attraction, but as anyone who has spent time travelling in India will know, some temples become attractions and places that non-Hindus come to look at. Seemingly, any temple with a ""monkey"" moniker will attract tourists and those... The Monkey Temple is interesting, beautiful buildings but , unfortunately , very neglected, The area is very dirty . It could be a great attraction if it would be better maintained and clean. What a shame! This was not on our tour but we had been told by another traveller not to miss it, It was close to the hotel so we stopped by lots of monkeys and their deposits Granted I only had just enough time to arrive, walk up to the area where the women bath, interact with the monkeys for about 15 minutes, then leave with just enough time to get to the airport for my flight back to Bengaluru.  But in... Good views if you can get to the top without being hastled to be given a bindi or flowers or paying to take a photo of a cow. Off the beaten track, not that many tourists, it's a working temple. An absolutely beautiful drive and very cheap to visit, however the minute we walked in we were hounded by a guide who calls himself the ""monkey whisperer"" who then took over our visit.  We were looking forward to exploring by ourselves and he took our... We went for the monkeys of course but were surprised to find such a beautiful temple complex tucked into the mountains. Yes the place is very dirty and smelly due to the cows, monkeys and piegons that call it home. During our visit we observed... I went because the others wanted to and its interesting but really smelly , maybe my stomach was not in a good way ( often isn't in India ) i could not wait to get away from the sneaky little buggars and their awful smell..... Extremely interesting place and mot only because of the monkeys. We went there with our kids which were pretty scared at the beginning and didn't want to leave the place at the end. A local guy was showing us the place and handling the monkeys.... extremely dirty!!! lots of dejects from cows-monkeys-pigs etcetera.. even so, the view from the hilltop is great, good for photos.. in the top , na interesting guru reception take out shoes
go there! Wow! This place is stunning-like a lost city in the middle of craggy hills. I couldnt stop staring and then you enter-its got pools of water, monkeys dipping inside the water, not swimming but bathing. People worshipping and the structure is magnificent. The drive here... Went here for the first time a few years ago and loved it. It's got a special feel to it and yes it's a bit dirty but it's easy to see past that. The monkeys are very friendly and get right up close but it's... There were a good few monkeys about but they were quite aggressive and trying to grab at us. The sellers and beggars were higly annoying.

Far more interesting than the monkeys were the views from the temple at the top out over the city. The monkey temple has the potential to be really cool, but unfortunately there is trash everywhere.  If you have your own tour guide it could be great.  If you are going alone, I wouldn't recommend it. It is a very nice place and I have seen a lot of baby monkays and  if you have some peanuts or bananas you are their best friend. SUMMATION: This is a really yucky, smelly, run down place, but worth a visit if you liked the TV show “Twilight Zone.”  High, poop- and banana peal-covered steps to a large, polluted pond and a temple nestled in a gorge in the mountain.  We had... It good but If I had done something else instead of visiting this temple I would had been better like visit the beach of the island or anything else. Disappointing visit. The pictures on the internet sites and tourist maps do not show the true pictures of a run down, dilapidated attraction, with filthy water that I would not put my toe in, never mind swim, like many of the devotees. We were asked... monkey temple was amazing we really enjoy there so many monkey there it was great day.
thanks my friend. Some of my best photos in India were taken here. Went at around 5PM as the sun was setting & temperature had cooled down. Lots of monkeys (as you would expect), cows with 5 legs & pigs roaming about. I had a guide which I... This temple is situated in the centre of Jaipur hustle and bustle.  We were pointed out twice in the day but did not have the time to visit the temple itself. Myself & my boyfriend got a tuk-tuk out to the monkey temple whilst staying over in Jaipur. When you first pull up at the bottom of the hill, it can seem a bit lack lustre, lots of cows, dogs, rubbish & people immediately running over... It's worth a visit - the view on the lake is beautiful.  Suddenly at sunset, a hoard of monkeys come down, it's quite surreal (a cow also joint them at one point).

Go from Jaipur centre with a tuk tuk driver and arrange the return... I enjoyed this despite average reviews, the temple needs a little work but I think that is half the charm, monkeys add something special to the visit The place is located approximately 10 kms outside the town of Jaipur and you have to drive a little thru the hills to access the place. The spot itself nestles in a valley between the hills and as with almost all places in Rajasthan is... First of all. Allthrough the animals are used to people. They are wild animals! A women was attacked just before we where there. She was bitten in the leg. Take a guide, they would keep you safe. Make sure you make a price before you... the place is really nice but please dont look in the eyes of red monkeys ..it's really dangourous. if you look in their eyes they might think that you are challanging them so they will attack you . when you feed monkeys be polite with... I truly enjoyed walking around and hiking up the monkey temple. The monkeys can be a bit annoying and they are smart enough to know that tourists have food in their pockets. As soon they see you reaching into get some peanuts (BIG bag sold... We have come to this Monkey Temple twice and had a fun day learning of the monkeys here at the temple. Wee met the monkey master on our first trip and got a great tour and pictures. He took our camera and got some amazing... Take a tuktuk to the entrance and then walk up the hill dodging hawkers, guides, monkeys and pigs. Keep going until they give up and leave you alone and you reach the Sun Temple on a ridge. Here you can keep going along the ridge... Two young girls had a very great experience. We would recommend to go with a young guy (standing at the buttom of the way to the temple) and let him guide you. We did that. Our driver talked to the guy and agreed the price... Must do activity if you are with are with family with young and teen kids.
Do hire a local guide at the temple which cost around Rs.200/- tip him if you are happy. You will love to hear the history of temple and will also... If being in close proximity of monkeys, and a lot of them at that, makes you a bit uncomfortable, DO NOT GO. but if you think you can manage that, i would recommend spending a couple of hours here, the monkeys, with their amusing antics... Monkey temple is great, there are monkey's everywhere.  I bought monkey food and had a boy as a guide (high school age) who was very knowledgeable - he helped me with the food and took me to the temple.  I would recommend going with one... It's different place to visit in jaipur . The best part is the view of the city of from monkey temple. Just be careful carrying any eatables in your hand. There are lot of monkeys on the way and they will snatch any eatables in... This is a very interesting place if you love animals. The Galtaji temple itself is quite small though the narration by the priest is interesting. The idols of the Hindu Trinity are different, The climb up is not very easy because of the uneven steps... This one is not so hot on the (Western) tourist attraction list in Jaipur but well worth adding to the itinerary. 
A decent hike from the main gate to the top of the hill presents stunning views of the Pink City, where you will find... Visited here at sunset which is a nice time to visit. Lots of monkeys around as you'd expect but some were quite vicious and you don't want to get bitten! We got guides who were knowledgeable and kept the monkeys at bay. View from the... Nothing better than seeing animals in a natural environment. The temple was beautiful. Full of 'little details' everywhere. The paintings from hundreds of years ago were something else. A definite must if in the Jaipur area. Small charge for entry and another small charge if... We were so excited when we saw our first group of monkeys, but the farther up the steps we went, the more there were. They were just lazing around and grooming each other. Great photo ops. We walked into a patch of grass where baby... Brings lots of treats!  Be mindful and know these are monkeys. Otherwise have fun feeding them and letting them crawl all over you! Be aware that these animals are wild and are use to being fed they will steal the bags of food of you if you don't watch them.  Also don't pay over the odds from the sellers of the nuts!!  But it's a wonderful place to... Must see for Hindu devotees. I first time saw so many monkeys at a public place, they are so many in numbers and yes, they are too much naughty. But I’m sure you are going to enjoy it a lot like I did. I would... We visited here with our 4 year old Son and we had a great couple of hours. The temple and the surrounding area is absolutely beautiful and would be worth a visit even if you weren't interested in the monkeys.
The monkeys are fab and... What an amazing day it was to spend time with the animals and premises   The monkeys are hilarious and never seem to get full despite our constant feeding. The surrounding rock formations are breath taking and it's very tranquil there as well. Go in the... Carry some bananas or you can buy them just outside the temple.
Be careful while feeding the monkeys. Their number increases in geometric progression as soon as they see food. A great experience of the eastern edge of Jaipur. Some of the most glorious views of Jaipur is to be enjoyed around the temples. Be sure to take some pictures and maybe get some nuts for all the monkeys around. 

Sitting here just before sunset... this is a little gem we went at dawn and the place was empty save for the holy men doing their prayers and the 3000 monkeys who hang around the temple The temple site is on the eastern edge of Jaipur and it was a wonderful place to visit.  We entered the site through an arched gate and it is quite a walk so have enough with you to drink before heading up to the temple;... Other reviewers complain that this temple is neglected and dirty. Fair comment but that could be part of the attraction. The only compulsory charge is 50 rupees (50 pence) for the use of your camera but a contribution towards upkeep is suggested. It's worth getting... loved visiting the monkey temple, we had a blessing done by the pandit. The temple is set in the hills and the scenery is stuning. Our driver stopped here , to show us this Temple where many monkey live.He organised the Monkey whisperer man to walk in the temple with us, as these monkeys have a mind of their own and need some discipline, and they actually listen to him.... I don't know why the good things are at the top of hills! Be prepared for a bit of a hike up and down hills...it isn't too hard as the road is paved and winds it's way up,so the slope isn't as steep as it... After a nice day in Jaipur with the elephants, on our way out our driver took us to the monkey temple. 
We paid to get in, camera charge was minimal but still a charge... We walked up to the main square, it was all a... I hope this is the same monkey temple that is also the only temple in India where the deities are the Sun couple. It's an arduous climb before you reach the temple and take in the amazing view from the top.

The path up to... nothing much other than a neglected place that hasnt been cleaned for years
The water where some local people were bathing was rank 
your greeted by people who only want your money for having cameras or video recorders
It could be so nice  but is... it's worth to go to Monkey Temple (rent a motorbike) after visiting Jaipur. you will pass more rural areas and nice building complexes on the way. temple is out of the city and gives you opportunity to relax after city noise. although buildings are not... Beside my fear of monkeys this place was mediocre, there are better temples, forts and palaces to see in Jaipur. But I guess it's good at sunset to watch over the city as the sun goes down. The monkeys are a little scary as one... This was my favorite attraction so far. You pay 50 rupees for taking in a camera. There are monkeys everywhere and the buildings are beautiful. Once of the best sights is the pool where the monkeys are diving in and swimming and having a great... This is my favourite place in Jaipur. It's not as popular as City palace and forts, and it's really sanctuary for locals. The atmosphere will absorb you. I went there today. I paid extra to have a ""monkey master"" guide and don't regret it. He was amazing (Vikas) he guided us through and told us the history. Also I felt more safe having him guide the monkeys to us. The monkeys were... Sooo, the city is definitely cool and interesting to see the 'oldness' of it, but it looks completely run down. Monkey overload in that they took over the place, so its dirty. The fountains are dirty and really not a whole lot to see. Monkeys... This was the first place I visited and is my far one of the highlights. I went around 6pm which is when I would advise anyone else to go, as this is the time the caretaker (or monkey man as he likes to call himself)... The temple is very poorly maintained but still very beautiful and, of course, the monkeys are very funny to be around, (with the necessary precautions). At the end of the tour the monkey master guy asked us for 200 rupees for the 10 minute walk... Close to the old town and a relatively short walk up.  Lots of monkey to feed if you like monkeys!  Great view of Jaipur and spectacular sunset.  Nice to visit early evening.  Monkeys can bite so be careful, they also fight with each other! We felt like Mowgli from the Disney movie ""The Jungle Book"". We saw this place on the Discovery channel and informed our private guide we wanted to visit and loved it! I am sure the Jungle Book based the scene were the monkeys lived, in... There are only a few kilometers to go, but it's worth it. You can make a few good photos. The overall impression of the system seems a little neglected. Be careful of Monkeys We went to the Monkey Temple early morning and really expected it to be just ok ,
It turned out to be really good the Monkey man (keeper walked with us ,a very interesting man and not doing it for the tips but we did... I've read some of the other reviews which made negative comments about the Galwar Bagh, and I had a completely different experience. We arrived late in the afternoon after our taxi driver got lost (another story), but once there, we were asked to pay a... We thoroughly enjoyed the stop and are highly recommending it to anyone going back.  The monkeys were part of the fun, but the whole temple grounds echo with a history that must have been overwhelmingly beautiful and spiritual.  The touts are annoying and persistent here,... i never seen so many monkeys together. people are throwing eatable things to them and they are catching that ..... but i fell it is quite unhygienic..... if you have short time then better ti leave...... We didn't have high expectations, but were quite surprised. The monkeys are curious and skidish at the same time. Watching the pecking order is really fascinating. I suggest you just sit and watch them for some time. Don't bother getting a guide, not needed. We... We were driving from Agra, and love animals, so we also stopped at Keoladeo National Park Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary on our drive to the monkey temple.  It was a narrow windy drive up to the temple.  We had about an hour of sunlight left, and... A bit outside Jaipur. It's okay, but not really a 'must-see', especially if you're short of time. The monkeys are cute- especially the babies and they are pretty tame so you can feed them. You don't need a guide so ignore all the offers! Unfortunately... This is a must visit place whilst you are in Jaipur - buy a couple of bags of peanuts at the entrance and make your way to the garden on the right hand side - the monkeys will be all around you taking the nuts... Our driver arranged for us to spend an hour with the monkey expert at the temple and we had a wonderful experience.  he showed us how to feed the monkeys and explained the hierarchy of the monkeys to us so we could understand their behaviour.... careful with the monkeys if you have food in your hand.....worth the trip excellent views from the top, wonderful vibe inside the temple. Be very careful of aggressive monkeys.. Take a money teacher with you.. They flip out very quickly.. The temple is ok.. Nice to go somewhere a little different It  is  worth  visiting  it.  You  will  need  a  guide,  a yong  boy  who  lives  there  and  who  has  been  living  with  the  monkeys  fos  some  years  and  knows  how  to  handle  them. You  will  feed  them  and  visit  their  house.  It  was good  fun... We took an a/c car to Monkey Temple which is a good thing because it is not close to the city. The place is very beautiful and there are monkeys everywhere.  You can purchase fruit or peanuts for 30, 40, 50 rupees to feed the... When I went it was raining so it was slippery getting up and down so wear sensible shoes, not flip flops even if it isn't raining the stones are quite smooth. We fed the monkeys monkey nuts and there were really friendly and gentle as... - Don't feed the monkeys. Locals feed them in the evening so they get enough food: there is even food just lying around untouched. The monkeys are really tame. Don't believe the local who say you need protection, they just want to sell their services.... This temple was one of the highlights of my India trip. The locations is just outside the city gates and there are two possible entries. On one side, you have to pay a fee for your camera - if you bring one - and on... Whilst the temples clearly have history and religious meaning, this place was spoilt by excessive rubbish/litter, animal excrement and stench. A pre-historic Hindu pilgrimage site, the Galtaji Temple, is located only 10km away from Jaipur. One of the jewels of Jaipur, the temple complex encompasses natural fresh water springs and 7 holy 'kunds' or water tanks. 

Among these kunds, the 'Galta Kund', is the holiest... We went here with a little time to kill having seen all of the other sights in Jaipur. Pretty dirty area where you get dropped and the walk up is lined by over-friendly monkeys and a few snake charmers. The temple itself isn;t that great,... I think this attraction could be much better - was out first attraction in Jaipur while the architecture had much promise, it was allowed into disrepair and mostly empty structures. Indeed you can feed some monkeys - or rather you can have some monkey's take... We were taken here by our guide and I am glad we went. Quite a climb to the top but lots to see on the way up. The monkeys were quite friendly however you need to avoid the cows and cow poo on the way... It's now my favourite place in Jaipur! I had a long walk through crowded, noisy, dusty Pink City and reached the place just before the sunset. The only disturbing thing are those helping guys who push their company to protect you from the monkeys and... This was a great escape from the crowds. Felt super undiscovered. The monkeys were not aggressive and the local people very helpful. We were brought here by our tuk-tuk 'friend', who introduced us to his young guide 'friend'. Quite a climb up and down the other side to actually get to the temple, which is quite dilapidated and not praiseworthy. Our guide told us very little, and... The huge complex is good but a little deserted. Not safe for women travelling alone. But the monkeys are really cute. They walk with you, talk peanuts from your hands and even play with you! The drive to the monkey temple was very unpleasant for us. I would not do it in an auto. The entrance to the temple was seemingly overcrowded with people living there. The temple itself could have been so beautiful, and in a way was, but... I quite enjoyed this temple. Not much in the way of beauty as there are more spectacular places to visit but the monkeys were amazing. Extremely friendly and I feed them some seeds. I must have visit on dusk as everyone was bathing in the... We were very fortunate to hook up with the man that speaks to the monkeys, and thus enjoyed feeding and interacting with them.  This is more of an active worship site than simply a tourist attraction.  Consequently, it was not particularly clean not did it... It was run down and no where near as touristy as all of the other places we visited in India. It wasn't even on our list of places to visit. I mentioned I'd love to see some monkeys to our driver and he was a... This place is really special.  It takes you on a hill and already the way (you should walk) to the temple is amazing because of all the friendly monkeys everywhere around you. The temples itself are very quiete and peaceful places.  That one on the... Clearly, I loved this place but mostly because I LOVE monkeys, if you don't... I don't think it would be massively interesting for you. You do see a nice view of the city from the top of the hill, but to get there you have... Very beautiful ...monkey...too friendly...not afraid of human contact.  The palace itself was awesome.  Worth visiting...I visited in March 2012 Dodge the bouncers at the bottom who offer to protect you from the monkeys they are 100% unnecessary. There are monkeys a plenty and great views over Jaipur. The temple itself is a fizzer and is hardly worth the effort but the views over Jaipur... This temple is totally different from any other temple we visited in Delhi, Agra or Jaipur. It is a very spiritual place dedicated to Hanuman, the monkey faced god and walking through its spaces is a true experience. Needless to say it is full of... Ask your driver to drop you off at the rear, where the bathing temples are (Galtaji Temple).  That’s an interesting walk up (the pools were packed when we were there).  Above that, the main attraction are the monkeys.  There are tons of them.  Bring a... A nice guy shows you around, in a peaceful atmosphere. The macacus rhesus are amazing, their touch when picking the fruit you give them is delicate and gentle. The babies are wonderful. Unlike many other visitors, what we found the most interesting in Galwar Bagh were not the monkeys (although if you are looking for somewhere to see them very close, it is a good place), nor the temple itself (interesting, but not a must-see). For us,... I went to the temple on a day my friend had enough of India, stayed back at the hotel curled up in the fetal position. 

As other people have stated, this area was some pretty aggressive kids who will latch onto you  to provide a... It's a rickshaw ride outside the main city.  I was cold to start with and when we arrived it poured down.  Walking up to the temple you are hassled first if you need a monkey trainer/guide and second if you are going to take photos.... My friend and I went to Jaipur for business dealing.  We spent 4 days and 3 nights in Jaipur. We went to Galwar bagh temple, which is situated at a 10km distance from the city.  The temple complex is surrounded by greens of Aravalli hills,... The site takes a bit of walking to reach (depending on which side of the hill you enter, I entered on the city side, so it took about 20-30min of tiring walk to reach it). On the way there are quite a lot of monkeys.... Monkeys are kind of aggressive and even sick here :/ Not what we were expecting. If we had known we would have spent our limited time somewhere else. In its heyday, it must have been quite an amazing site, but like many buildings in India, it has been left in disrepair. Women, men and monkeys still bathe themselves in the very dirty waters of the sanctuary however. The monkeys are pretty much everywhere... The moment we stepped out of our tuktuk we realized we were not going to have an enjoyable experience: teen boys were jostling to be our 'protectors', we were encouraged to purchase peanuts from a younger boy to feed the monkeys, a cobra was thrust... Maybe I had too high expectations, but nevertheless I was disappointed. Yes, there were monkeys, but monkeys are almost everywhere. The temple at the top is quite unattractive, but it does provide an excellent overview of the city. I went there for the first time with 6 students in two tuk tuks. It was quite remarkable and after a very steep climb, passing literally hundreds of monkeys, the view from the top over the city was surprisingly good (not as good as Nahargarh... We were very disappointed with the monkey palace. Arrived mid morning and not a monkey in sight. However, while we were there noticed monkeys being herded from the nearby hill towards the temple area, no doubt to be around for arriving tourists. The temples were... We loved the monkey palace. No one was trying to sell us anything.  The monkeys were so cute and friendly, eating peanuts and bananas out of our hands. The monkey whisperer has lived among the monkey's for many years and shared interesting information. I had a wonderful experience at the monkey temple. I wanted to meet monkeys, i had a friendly, knowledgeable guide (student who was enthusiastic to show me around the temple), and took pictures while i wandered about. As someone that believes that animals are sentient... I went here with my 2 boys aged 9 and 12, whew really liked it. Lots of monkeys, pretty temple. Definitely get a local guide or you could end up at the top of the hill surrounded by monkeys unable to get down. It's serene... In that case you wont mind the monkeys or anything else but otherwise they are not such a pleasing sight. Would recommend only if you are a devotee or an animal enthusiast. This is in one of the poorer areas of Jaipur - so be careful of wallets etc.

The walk to the temple is nice (if a bit litter strewn).

The monkeys are entertaining - dont let them bite you if you feed them with the... Not sure this is worth the drive/walk. The temple itself is tiny and not really well kept. The walk up is one spent in the company of lots of (vaguely menacing) monkeys and lots of litter. The best thing up here is the view out... the lake is beautiful, as well as the buildings in india style. the monkeys also give a peculiar visual. interesting place to visit! I had the chance of visiting this temple on my way from Agra; our driver recommended it and I heard about it before.  It is for the adventurous and not for the ones easily scare by wild animals. This is a trully Indian site that... If there's one temple to visit in Jaipur, this is it.
The monkeys and other animals that greet you as you leave your transport are cute and photogenic. Indeed, the 'monkeys' who pester you to employ them as guides/protectors are more of a menace! The... Janu organised our tour to the monkey temple and we were lucky enough to have a wonderful driver Belal. The tour of the monkey temple took approximately one hour and Belal waited for us to return and drove us back to our hotel door. The... First, only go by auto-rickshaw making sure you approach through all the villages from the North.  That way you are dropped off only 100 metres or so from the palace. Make sure the driver will wait an hour and a half for you.  There's no... I found it culturally very interesting, especially the people's attitude towards the monkeys, it was quite a climb, so good exzersize in many ways, a vibrant temple with bathing!. After reading a few reviews here I was left wondering what people's expectations were of India? Yes there will be rubbish, yes they will be the odd smell, yes people will always be after your money but it is not a first world country! For... After cityhopping, this was a pleasant visit. The journey there in a autorickshaw is lovely, the scenery is nice. The temple itself is lovely, monkeys all around you who are happy to get eat some nuts from your hand. Take the route that takes you... The temple and the devotion of the people are heart warming. Feel good factor of any place of worship is there. But I am scared of monkeys :(. That made me very very apprehensive. But there were people enjoying with them too. We were in Jaipur as part of a guided multi-day tour.  We had a half-day on our own, so we were thrilled at the opportunity to go see the famed monkey temple.  Our regular guide confirmed that this was the most famous temple of its... We toured the Monkey Temple while staying in Jaipur ... not a place I would recommend. It's a run down ruin with monkeys running all over the place and a few cows thrown in for good measure. There are pools at the top of the... It would have been excellent if there were no monkeys. Or if i liked monkeys. rest was an awesome experience. the devotion of the people. the people taking their dips in the water. worth a visit I heard of this and thought it would be like a pagoda with a monkey statue inside. It's not. It's the remnants of a 17th century fort (I presume - sure looks like a way to control trade in the valley to me) but as... Such a beautiful place that is in terrible condition. Worth a visit but few things to note: priests will ask for money at each temple and can get aggressive if you don't make a donation. Monkeys are pretty mellow, but they may approach you if... Please visit this temple in the evening during sunset, we went in the afternoon and it was so hot, we could not enjoy. The temple was so nice, we were not at all forced for money which is rare in Indian tourist places. It would have been best if not for all the boys who harassed you to be their guides as the monkeys can be aggressive.  Not true.  Watch were you step, as their is dung everywhere, but it is worth you time.  make sure you do... Really nice, peaceful place on a hill, with a good view over the city. There are lots of monkeys on the walk up and you can feed them with nuts sold at the start gate. Just don't believe the boys down there, who persistently keep... I visited just before the sunset and the view at the top is just out of this world! You can see the whole of Jaipur and watching the sun set over it was amazing. Well worth the walk up there although it is a killer!... Incredible complex of temples nestled in the foot hills. Monkeys are a bit more, but it is their temple, right? :) You can enjoy a variety of animals - squirrels (of course - they are everywhere in India :), peacocks that live in the wild... My wife and mother decided to stay in the taxi, being a little afraid of monkeys. Turns out while my sons and I were off walking up the hill, a whole gang of monkeys came and started jumping up and down on the car roof!... Nothing spectacular, temple itself is ugly and a lot of hustle with those guys wanting to be your guide even though  you don't need one. Those monkeys are aggressive. Avoid it I love monkeys, so it makes sense that I thoroughly enjoyed this place. However, even without the monkeys, the walk up the hill and back down again to the Galtaji Temple would be well worth a visit. You get outstanding views of Jaipur, and a... Our Driver brought us here on the way to Jaipur as part of the golden triangle tour, although it was not on the official litinery.

As with any tourist attraction in India there is always someone trying to make you part with your money but... When you go certainly be careful and take a tour guide.  There are pigs, monkeys and cows everywhere.  The monkeys are pretty crazy.  There is a lovely temple at the top of the walk.  It's pretty hot.  If you're a girl be careful there and... I always wanted to visit the Monkey Temple after seeing it in some documentries, the place was nice although my visit was during a very hot afternoon. It was really greay seeing the monkeys interaction specially around water, a very interesting change for photography too... Unfortunately the Monkey Temple in Jaipur is a dirty and rather decrepit place. The view from the top is nice and the many monkeys are funny for a while. This does not hide the fact that the temple and the road up are falling appart... You don't want to miss this place, it is goegeous. The only downfall was the amount of scalpers all over the place, we had to raise our voice at them a few times, otherwise they just wouldnt take no for an answer One of the most amazing places I visited in India, I have a lot of good memories at Monkey Temple. The monkeys, the cows, the sight of Jaipur from the place, the lake.... I went and was very excited. I spent some time taking pictures of monkeys, who suddenly got busy attacking my poor tour guide.
Not sure that I want to go again. My driver suggested this place during my Golden Triangle Tour, although it wasn't part of my official itinerary. I'm glad I went out of our way to visit, as it was very unusual, fascinating and resembled India to a tee for me. ""Be on the... free , small charge for camera , when you get to the temple through the mountain you get a real surprise how lovely it is , nice walk surroundings very peaceful monkeys , did not bother you walking about there .  well worth a visit Out of the tourist circuits, is empty of people, but full of monkeys, and you must take care of them. A very good place to take pictures, and very courious temple. Easy to get a tuk tuk through the old part of Jaipur to this temple where there are lots of monkeys, cows, goats, birds etc.  There was an Indian wedding while we were there and we were thrilled to be invited to join in.  The... So, the story is that the rock of the cliff face around which this temple is built looks like Hanuman.  I saw the painting over the top that didn't follow the shape of the rock at all, and the painting was cool.  I didn't see... I believe these monkeys were gentler than others  experienced  later on our trip.  Still be mindful as they can be aggressive and hiss.  They  frolic about and  can be territorial.  I was delighted. If you are looking for a nice view of Jaipur this is a decent place for it, other than it...not much and outside of the city. There are a lot of monkeys wandering around like many other places in India, and the temple is not... THis is what we envisioned India as.  Ancient temples and stairways.  Unfortunately the locals zero in on tourists.  The call for 'baksheesh"" is often.  The best part is the monkeys.  Them with the backdrop of the old temples is worth the hassle of the people.... The walk up and chatting to the locals and the chai seller at the bottom were fun. At the top there is a nice view but the temple is certainly not a must see small and not really special except in its location. The monkeys... I was approached by young boys at the entrance of the Monkey Temple. They were asking for 100 ruppees to be the guide and to prevent monkeys for frightening or assaulting me.
Actually there is no need for a body guard. I didn't ask any... My boyfriend and I are real fans of wildlife and loved getting up close to these monkeys and being able to feed them.  The priest at the temple was very helpful in keeping the monkeys from being too rowdy, but he did lock us in... Good for monkeys....don't let monkey guy walk you around. He'll stalk you by being nice, then ask get mad at a 100rs tip saying this is not much. Not much for someone I didn't want???? Strange. 
Monkeys were cool...just avoid the money master trying to... Bring nuts to give to the monkeys.  This place is wild.  Can not believe no one lives here.  You will be walking up hill, so definately wear walking or hiking shoes. Monkeys were amazing and the views really good over the city but a little seedy and scary as we visited at sunset and we felt a bit insecure. May be OK during the day. don't go up without a guide as the monkeys can bite... Monkey Temple, real name is Galtaji, or Hanuman Temple is secluded place at the outskirts of Jaipur. Main pathway is covered with granite, stone, low quality marbles, so please take good care not to slip. Back road -via Agra Road- is longer, only for vehicles,... This was a big disappointment as we had been promised thousands of monkeys splashing in the pools but although there were thousands of pigeons, some parrots and a few holy bulls, there wasn't a monkey in sight This doesn't get much attention in the tour books, but it's a short distance from downtown Jaipur, and definitely worth it. Bring your camera to capture great photos of the hundreds of monkeys who inhabit this abandoned town. There is a nice view. That's all I can say for this. You can get a comparable view from the top of the minaret in the Pink City. This was a long walk, the temple is very below average, and I have seen enough monkeys... After along hike up a hill with a young ""guide"" our taxi driver found for us, we had a great view of the city, and a look inside a small temple, but nothing special. We asked about the temple down the hill on the other... It has many names, most popular are Galtaji Temple or Galwar Bagh meaning Monkey Temple.
I think the best idea for one good spectacular trip is to start in the afternoon. If you feel quite young, take one tuk-tuk to the Galta Gate (26°55'5.37""N   75°50'59.04""E)... my boyfriend and I visited the Temple in Feb 2013

now, we didnt have a tour guide for Jaipur, so perhaps this may have something to do with my lack of interest, but in all honesty, i felt my time could have been better spent... It's definitely a sight to see. Monkeys everywhere and locals that come to bathe in the holy water. The temple is a bit run down but I think that's the beauty of it. Beware of the ""guides"" who will ask for money for following you... The kids loved it.. Best is to bring losts of Food.. they eat bread and fruits.. it was fun to see SOOO many different monkeys,  The temple itself is beautiful. Not sure what we were expecting and it was smaller than we expected and we were so glad we had our guide with us who could answer all our questions, take us to the best spots for taking photos and generally enhanced our visit no... In general I don't like monkeys, but I had to see this unusual temple. Janu from Janu Private Tours drove us there, but three young boys accompanied us to the top. They were happy to help us and earn some coins. Among other things they... Nothing great it takes 10 min its minimal price fir entry you get a guided tour for a small tip...but if you like monkeys then you will be satisfied ...there are lots and entertaining This temple was so fun, monkeys roaming around all over the place. So much to see goats, birds, monkeys, hogs. It's very steep and a lot of walking is involved so be prepared for this. Lots of beggars around, snake charmers were quite entertaining tho. Our rickshaw driver took us there and we met a guide at the bottom who accompanied us up the hillside with his 2 dogs. He told us that a monkey had attacked someone, another had grabbed a tourist's camera, they all had rabies and could... If you really want to see a monkey temple then you will be impressed. They line the walkway up to the temple and cavort within the temple. Watch you stuff and mind the monkey scat. A bit of a drive outside of Jaipur lays the monkey temple. On a clear day it has amazing sunset views. Even when it is cloudy you can still get a good overview over Jaipur and watch kids playing cricket. The way up takes about... I managed to persuade my youngest son (21) to come with me and it was an easy ride in a tuk-tuk to get there. An easy stroll up a winding road with monkeys, pigs, cows and dogs sharing the path with us. The animals are... We enjoyed the temple so much. It was fun with the monkeys, and also a beautiful quiet place. Most local people, not so many tourists. Best time to visit is around 17:30 - 18:00 for sunset as this is when the monkeys come out of the shade and are moving about more. Views from the temple at the top are spectacular with panoramic views over Jaipur. Date of Visit: 25th Mar 2013

Fees: No entry fee, I think parking is 30 INR

+ points:
(1) Some parts of the area are quite photogenic.

(2) The view of Jaipur at the top is decent but not spectacular. I found the view from... You can get there be rickshaw obviously, but for those who are more about exploring and doing stuff on their own, there are buses going there. Just ask the bus drivers. From bani park area you can take bus 5 till te pink city then... You can get there be rickshaw obviously, but for those who are more about exploring and doing stuff on their own, there are buses going there. Just ask the bus drivers. From bani park area you can take bus 5 till te pink city then... If you love animals - go there! We went in the afternoon and it was refreshing to go out of the town and be in total silence (compared to the traffic noice down town). There were only two other tourists there. Watch out for locals... This is pretty boring to be honest. Yes sure, if you want to waste an hour, purchase 2 bags of overpriced peanuts and then spend the next hour feeding monkeys, I can think of worse things to do, but that's all it is. The ""temple""... Obviously if you don't especially like monkeys, if you are not used to India's dirtyness (manure everywhere) or poverty this is not a suitable activity for you.
Otherwise, it is an amazing stop to make.  There are about 5,000 monkeys running free in the mountain... Be prepared to pay a coin donation if you enter the temple part at the top. Best part is the climb and the view. It's sunny on the way up. Amazing example of architecture built in the rocks to blend into the landscape.  You see it when it is immediately in front of you - not before.  The ""Monkey Man"" will greet you and only ask for 50 rupees for your camera.  I took his... When visiting Temples one should remember that shoes are not allowed in the Temples, which was really not a problem for us. We did not get any rain so it was not bad. If you love monkeys, you must check out the Galwar Bagh! If you've seen your fair share, you can skip over the monkey temple. It provides a nice view of Jaipur but that's about it (unless of course, you want to hang out with monkeys!). go! it's so beautiful, stunning architecture and landscape and a real pleasure to watch the monkeys. you'll take amazing photos here, but be warned it is one of the dirtier sights... and you have to remove shoes as it's a temple.. so take extra socks!! Off the tourist track, spent nearly 2 hours looking round,so much to see,including friendly monkeys , had a guild name of monkey king,he knew all the names of these animals,wonderful architecture,many people bathing,and sighting . Forget the small agrvations and hassles and enjoy the moment. All the usual touts are around to offer assistance but you should be able to handle them by now. I can't understand why I pay 50ir for my camera while everyone else carries a cellphone,... Photos of buildings and reading about the monkeys enticed me to this locale.  Description of the filth here was not exaggerated but this is India.  Water also dirty.  If keepers would charge admission and use the money to keep area clean, it might attract more... We loved visiting the ""monkey"" temple. Not only were the monkeys fun, but the temple was wonderfully full of women who were celebrating something special. They were full of laughter and beauty and wisdom and peace. Be sure to buy bananas on the way so... I loved the trip there, the number of monkeys around you is really impressive and the views of the city quite special as well. Best to visit around sunset. Be prepared for a lot of children trying to be your guides. You don't need any... This was where the documentary for TV was filmed last year and unfortunately the local kids still think they can make a killing. Unless you are very firm you will be mobbed. You don't need a guide nor do you need a person to protect... The name sounds cool until you actually get there. The road that leads to the temple is crowded with kids-beggers, that are following you. There were less monkeys and more pigs, dogs and cows. The road is very dirty. The temple itself is nothing impressive.... the view at sunset is well worth it but otherwise this monument has not a great deal to offer.
at the bottom of the hill we were subject to a bit of hassle until the boys decided who would be our ""guide"". he basically keeps... Great off-the-beaten path temple without too many zealots or people out to take your money.  The hilly scenery, the friendly monkeys running around, and lack of tourists make this a great stop.  Try for the morning when it's less hot and before too many other... This was surreal! Obviously it smells of poop, but the monkeys are very tame and allow you to hand food to them (go 90% let the monkey come the other 10%).  The local people are always trying to make money from you and you have... This was a great experience. Animals of all sorts - cows, goats, monkeys - living side by side with humans. Well worth a visit if you haven't seen monkey temples elsewhere.

At the start of the walk, children will run up to you and try... A real out of the way temple where not many people see as part of an organized tour, so escapes the chaos of hundreds of people shoving about for pictures etc. you do have to pay for photos (150 rupees iirc) we also paid for... This was so much fun. I bought a bag of nuts at the gate, if you do this, guard it with your life! The first monkey we saw made a swift incision at the bottom of the bag spilling them everywhere! We saw about 10... If you want to see monkeys this is the place to go. They just sit around, lots of them, all the way up to the temple. It's a nice walk up a hill. They are everywhere, it is quite the place.  It was during a celebration and people were bathing in the water, enjoying the beautiful weather and the spiritual connection. This place is definitely worth a visit. Monkeys are very fun, especially to watch them playing around in the temple pools. There are so many of them, and they are very friendly. There is no entrance fee, but you will have to pay some small... We really loved this attraction! Sometimes sight seeing can become very ho-hum but this was very different. One nice thing too is it is a very peaceful and relaxing walk up the hillside and it offers great views. The monkeys are really fun to watch... The temple is over 1000 years old and located in a very rural area. The upside to visiting it was viewing all the peacocks that occupy the surrounding countryside. The temple itself is dirty and smells of the many monkeys that inhabit the place.  I... This is a really interested location and its not just a home for monkeys but also cats, dogs, chicken, pigs and cows.  If you are an animal lover then you love the walk to the temple and all of the monkeys running out and begging... Very well behaved monkeys abound in this Hindu place of worship. Completely off the beaten path and complete with dancing cobras in a basket. You have to climb a mountain to arrive to the Monkey Temple but you will have the amazing views of nature and city of Jaipur. Really worthy. We walked one hour to arrive there, stayed in the temple for 30 min and 1 hour to... Lots of monkeys obviously, and well worth the walk up if only for the amazing views accross the city Located in a quiet ravine at the head of a valley, the Monkey Palace is a pleasant visit for animal lovers and those who appreciate ornate architecture in a peaceful setting. There were fewer monkeys than we expected, which was good as we had envisaged... The monkey temple has its name only because it (mostly the way uphill to it) is indeed overrun by monkeys. You can take very close pictures of them or even buy some nuts and feed them yourself, but do take care as they can steal... This temple is a waste of time.  The road up is run down and full of monkeys which you would expect.  The main attraction about this temple is to feed the monkeys!  However, I did not come to India to see monkeys.  If you are... Not worth a visit!  I went up to the monkey temple and found not much there, other than a decent view across Jaipur from the small temple itself.  For the rest, it was incredibly run down with pigs and monkeys everywhere, most of which were... Walking up to the Monkey Temple you are greeted by many monkeys. As you climb the hill up the cobbled path so your views become better and better. Take your time to walk along the hill past the temple it is quite and peaceful. Sunsets... This was one of the most wonderful places I visited in India. Stunning architecture and the most charming and seemingly happy monkeys The temple and surroundings are very beautiful and great to explore however the place is swarming with beggars and not too many monkeys but that may be unique to the day we visited. If you wanna hang out with some monkeys and risk getting a communicable disease, this is probably the place to do it.

A place is few kilometers from Jaipur and it felt almost a bit spooky to see those empty palaces full of monkeys, dirt and monks offering to tell you an ancient stories in return for money.

A jewel in... Its good to go very early when few if any tourists.Lovely to walk through the locals going about their business and walk up the hill with monkeys everywhere.Great view from top Visited on a weekend and was thoroughly entertained by the local youth jumping off the high walls into the pools.

The temple isn't really the reason to make the climb, there are several interesting buildings...

Lovely views from the top of the temple & interesting to watch local men & women... Lovely desert scapes nice walk up there, great view of the city. Lovely photo opportunities, both at the temples and during the walk. When we went there were not only an abundance of monkeys but also an abundance of baby animals!

Bring drinking water along... One of my best experiences in India.
We went at late afternoon, and got to the top for sunset, the views of Jaipur were absolutely amazing.
It was a bit dangerous driving back at night so i would suggest leaving as soon as the sun... Don't get me wrong this place is interesting but only go into the gate and feed the monkeys the monkeys up the hill expect food and can get vicious and bite, some are huge and others are very protective of their baby's. 

My driver waited... This was not on my itinerary, but my driver rerouted me there and told me to give his mate Rs200 to show me around.  I was stranded in the middle of nowhere so my hands were tied.

Not a lot of travellers visit here though I think they should, even the drive there is special tourist industries must keep this kind of places cool When you arrive at the Monkey Temple you are bombarded by touts selling chickpeas and peanuts, children offering you safe passage up to the temple, farm animals, and stump-tailed macaques.  Don't pay more than 5-10 rupees per bag of goodies and avoid the self-appointed guides.... It's a nice walk up the hill, sweet little monkeys but very touristy and the building on the top (of course a temple) was just ugly (purple/pink). But the view over Japur is worth the walk!

Buy some nuts and feed the monkeys, they're really cute and in our case weren't agressive at all. Though offcourse you should treat them with caution!

There are three kids up there (one teenage girl and her two brothers) who will show you a hindu temple.  They are very nice kids.  They were flying a kite up there and...

And there was some crazy guy living halfway up the steps to the top of the hill. Worth the... Our driver suggested this place on arrival. He said we were passing the area and it would be fun to see the monkeys. When we arrived, he told us we could take a guide if we want explanations etc, but didn't have to. Suggested how...

Driving up the hill, seeing a priest or saddhu coming down the opposite direction with his huge white beard and sunglasses on a motorbike kind of set the tone.  The old building (palace?) has...

We were fortunate that he knew one of the active... We mainly went there for the monkeys, but soon discovered that the whole experience made it worth the long walk over the hilltop. Can hardly be described. Just go there, if you like architecture, culture and landscape scenery (and monkeys!).

It is a pity the palce is so run down as you can see from the paintings on the outside of the temple that this must have been glorious in its... Nothing great to see. Area very dirty. Pigs and cattle all around. It’s a fairly long walk and there is only a view from the top is over slumps. It’s not a must see when visiting Jaipur. I loved this place.

The monkey came and gently peeled away each finger to reveal the grapes then... The red face monkeys are so gentle compared to the others in the area and took fruit so softly from our hands. They gave a great display at the top temple by jumping of roofs and walls into a pond whilst playing - very amusing.... The place is actually beautiful...but not clean at all, not kept well...and ofcourse the monkeys ...they are all over..quite scary.. There is nothing extraordinary about this temple. There are a lot of monkeys along the walk to it and it has good views overlooking the city. The temple is worth visiting, it is located up on a hill, so do not forget to bring your water bottle!

Ignore all beggars. monkeys are great, people tryin to sell u crap are not!! They are the same monkeys made famous by the Discovery Channel series called ""Monkey Theives"" of the Galta Gang. A must visit for all Jaipur visitors. Was not on our  itinerary, but was taken to this (nearby) by local tuk tuk driver, so had no pre conceptions as to what it was all about.  And therefore had'nt read about the very long, long exhausting walk in the Indian summer mid day... This was out of the way and perhaps not many go there but well worth a visit.

I visited this temple and met the Monkey Man.  He is the attendant who looks after the monkeys at this temple.   This was a fun experience to feed the monkeys and just see them up close.  Oh yeah, the temple is interesting too. we could not make it up to the top it was so disgusting.  People were bathing in the pool with trash, clothes were litered everywhere, you had to watch for cow crap everywhere you stepped.  Not worth the extra trip and time. Admittedly, we went late in the afternoon but our driver dropped us off and left us to walk up with two money-hungry kids who thought they were going to get a huge tip.  Add to that, the overpriced peanuts to feed the monkeys.  By the... This place is a long walk but well worth the effort.  The temples are hidden amongst the rocks.

Of course, the men make a... Don't tease the monkeys, it's a sure way to get bitten.  

If you're there late afternoon, when a man on a motorbike brings a sackfull of bananas, stand to one side, it's like the charge of the light brigade.

Not a lot to the temple... You should be able to get a rickshaw here an back for 150-200 rupees.You walk up a hill, down again, and then between two temples to really reach the monkey temple. Keep walking! For our visit, monkeys were everywhere right from the first gate near... It's free and provides a beautiful view of the city! Plus, you can't help but take a million pictures of the adorable monkeys, pigs, and dogs on your way up. Great attraction. I agree, many taxi drivers were unaware of this place.

You can buy some peanuts before going in (and will pay a small... Very nice trip, close to city and takes 1,5 hours to do. Recommended and bring your camera! kids loved it.  dirty place, annoying 'guides', but totally splendid architecture/location.  heaps of unimpeded interaction with monkeys, lifetime memories of having them eat out of your hand, watching them groom/fight/feed. took 45 min by tuk tuk from our hotel, but totally worth it. We took a tuktuk and arrived at the bottom of the temple. There are monkeys everywhere! They don't disturb you so don't disturb them. There are so many of them that it can be a little unsettling so be wary. Someone may offer their 'guide'... Our driver (from Delhi) didn't even know this place as it is not one of the Top Spots in Jaipur. We enjoed the temple very very much, as it was vey little crowded and had a very magic and mystic athmosphere.

As there are not... the monkey temple was nice and we spent one hour there to take photos and walk around but the monkey god is a Hindu god, and this temple honors him ..for kind deeds done in mythology...certainly an interesting place to visit! This temple is not as exciting as many of the write ups would have you believe and not as dangerous either. The place is run down as you'd expect of an ancient ruin but the information boards and signs are not very helpful. The monkeys... WOW - this was an amazing part of me and my sister's trip to Jaipur.  I used Trip Advisor before I left to read up on some 'must-sees' and I think this should be higher on the list!  After visiting the main attractions we took... I went here because I am an animal lover and wanted to see the monkeys. First of all, to get there we had to go through a huge slum area that the stench was sickening. Once we arrived, we saw monkeys and there are lots... We enjoyed our time at the temple and surrounding grounds. We let one of the temple guys bless us for some money and that was just okay, kind of a boring moment but seemed like a nice thing to do. 

While walking down the stairs... I read all of the Tripadvisor reviews including those that reported some unpleasant experiences.  I found the place to be quite fascinating; beautiful old buildings and of course, the monkeys everywhere.  I did encounter a group of teenage boys sitting on the steps of one... Monkey/ Sun  Temple  was recommended to us, as a good place to see the sunset. I am not very sure if it is so attractive. The view from the monkey temple is ok, but nothing special. The temple itself is a small and nothing special.... I think it's worth to see being in Jaipur. Before entry to area you can buy some peanuts to feed monkeys. We were late afternoon, so there was almost no people, only monkeys. Throwing peanuts you have to be carefull, because monkeys want to take... Just to address the issue of safety: I can see why a person might feel uncomfortable coming here alone. When we went it was around 3:00 PM and it seemed rather lonely there. There were definitely people around, but not many. Those who were interested... DO NOT GO TO MONKEY TEMPLE ALONE OR WITHOUT A LARGE GROUP.

Reach atleast an hour before the sunset as the fort get closed before sunset so the tourist who are inside gets the... The best place in Jaipur for photography where you can click sunrise , sunset and whole Jaipur city photos The entry fees are decent but inside the charges of wax museum and sheesh Mahal which are opened only few years back are having high charges. To add further to commercialization there are a couple of restaurants opened in Nahargarh fort. The sunset point is... Skip it if you want. Not much to see here. Just restaurants and one palace which has now only bug brands name mentioned. Naharghar fort in Jaipur is one of the best place to visit for tourists and also provide facility of restaurant at the top of fort. This is the smallest but best fort among the three main forts of Jaipur. Enjoy with yiur freinds at Padav and RDB point So much fun to visit this fort took a bicycle ride up.  Refused to ride down way to fast.  Our guides were wonderful no problem they got us a car to come down.

At the summit we had the and refreshments .

Do not miss I love the restaurant that is located at nahargarh fort. It gives you a very cozy feeling after a you walk a kilometer to get there. there is nothing to see much here except for the big cannons. after the visit of amber fort, its lost its exictement . altouhg you are about the time of sunset, the view for here is pretty amazing and spectacular The view is worth going for if nothing else. The actual inside of the fort is more like a palace but all the rooms are extremely similar. They had an art exhibition on while we were there, which made us stay much longer than we... offering awesome views of the city, this fort is located on a hill surrounded by forest, truly adventurous and amazing In comparision to amber fort, there is nothing much to see at the fort except for the worlds biggest cannon. Though when we were leaving about sun set, its beautiful to look around the city from the fort there is nothing much to see in this fort except fort the biggest cannon that reside here. its nearby amber fort. but with large group or family one can enjoy. the view from this palace is though very beautiful the palace is not much breath taking itself but known the home of the largest cannon built around that century. there is nothing much to see in the palace itself after you have seem amber fort. however, when we were leaving the fort, it about... To be clear, Amer Fort is the only fort to visit in Jaipur. This one is not so good but you can get some good pictures on the perimeter of this fort. Everything else is just zilch. 

Another thing, if you going here by cab,... Nahargarh fort, apart from being a significant monument, offers the best view of Jaipur. The sunset view Tom here is not to be missed. The fort, with its architectural intricacies is a marvel. There is also a very ancient stepwell in the fort complex, which... a fort where all the weapons  collection of AMER used to be in old times.Quite big with a lot of available guides for better information.also has a beautiful garden called the CHAR BAGH and the world's biggest cannon It's a long climb up from Amber Fort, and for that reason few people do it.  However, with a bit of effort and mild fitness, the views are impressive.  There's very little history to learn, so I'd not recommend paying for entry if you don't... Pretty cool ride up to the fort....best view is during night.... couple of restaurants in the campus....had a really good time....nice piece of history too.... amazing architecture Definitely the most commercialised fort I visited in Jaipur. Which is sort of a shame as it takes away from the history of the fort. The views over the city are absolutely break taking though and well worth the visit and entry fee. The fort belongs to the Royal Family of Rajasthan.  The fort hosts the biggest cannon on wheels, wich is never used for war purposes, but only once for a trial use.  The caused damage was very big, so, they never tryed it again.  As everywere... It is near to amber fort, and about 8 km away from Jaipur.It is now modified & have  neat & clean.Best season to visit fort is October to march to avoid hotness. View of old city from Nahargarh fort is amazing. It's on top of the Aravali Hills where we can feel cool breeze. Nice place to visit It was good but not worth as per the cost of tickets....Took 500 per person, even for children above 5 years....Was good but not worth the money spent....They give us only 5 min in total inside the sheesh mahal...After that they ask us to leave... The fort is pretty beautiful but not open completely. 

I wish more of its area was accessible to tourists. Nahargarh fort is Huge but not maintained well. Most of the time you would feel that the artifacts placed in the rooms do not belong here (which they actually don't). There is not much to see inside the fort apart from admiring the architecture. However... This place is best to enjoy sunset and provides you the best view of Jaipur City from top. The architect is good, so the ambience till you within the fort. The wax museum is total waste of time and money. So if you like twisting mountain roads you will love the drive to this fort. 57 turns in all, highly reccommend to do this in a tuk tuk or motorbike to fully appreciate the journey. Once all 57 bends have been negoiated you reach the... You can book a cab from Jaigarh Fort and will reach the Nahargarh Fort within 10 mins. I love the journey from Jaigarh to Nahargarh for its scenic beauty. I found Nahargarh Fort little different from other forts of Rajasthan It has a huge collection... Whilst in Jaipur take time to explore the fort. Winding narrow road to reach the hilltop where the nahargarh fort is located. There are 2 types of charges (optional) for different activites:
1- entry fee only you experience the walkabout, architecture step well and the... Other forts of Jaipur will not give you the city view which this fort provides.
Although there is not much to see here as its a smaller fort but the best part is its location. Go when the sun is about to set, roam around... The fort has intrinsic interest itself.  However i thought that the modern art display they had cthere conflicted with the historical image of the fort.   

If time is a constraint  you may prefer to spend it on other forts. Decided to walk up to the fort, which really is a huge climb (once you find the badly signposted entrance). However, it's  along way round by road. Some very impressive views from the top but not a lot to see inside. Some modern sculptures, which... As this fort is located at the edge of the hill and completely at the top it provides a nice view of the city.. The fort by itself is average, the main tourist attraction is the view of sunset from the rooftop of the restaurant inside the fort. The fort has been commercialised by setting up a number of so called museums and exhibitions, but hardly worth the efforts... You'll love it when you see down from the top of Nahargarh fort. A view from the sunset point is fabulous. There's also Sheesh mahal, wax and durbar museum. They charge 500 INR for these three places. If you really want to view then try.... Nahargarh Fort provides an amazing view during the sunset. The fort is so well designed on the top of hill. The view of the city from this fort, is to die for. Smaller as compared to the Amber fort, but definitely worth visiting. There is a wax museum also inside the fort, separate charges for the entry. There are some restaurants inside as well as... I actually wasn't super impressed with this one. I mean the views of the city are amazing for sure, but it wasn't very big, and I just wasn't interested in spending much time there. There was a weird ""display"" going on while I was there,... The best part of this fort is the scenic beauty around the fort. So if you want to visit here spend some time here, just feel the nature. The fort in the periphery of Jaipur. Popular by the shooting of Rang De Basanti film. But the horrifying part is the pool filled with garbage (Same pool in which amir khan jumped in RDB). The best part is the bird eye view of  pink... Another place where king lived with his queens. This palace gives one of the best bird eye view of the old and New Jaipur city. You can see Hawa Mahal, Amer fort, city palace, jheel mahal, almost all the sites from this fort. Do not... There are many forts to be visited, but if you have to make a choice because of time constraints, Amber Fort is definitely the best. Jaigarh followed by Nahargarh deserve a visit only if you have enough time to spend in Jaipur. For all the lazy people get up and enjoy a romantic sunrise at nahargarh fort! This can’t be missed! And if you can’t get up then enjoy here at the night time where you can see whole JAIPUR lit up from the mountain top! Nahargarh Fort on the edge of the aravali hills looks over the city of Jaipur. This place can be visited with Jaigarh and Amer Fort as all three are in same vicinity. It’s a bit underrated tourist spot. Really good architecture and location however not well maintained. Parking and access is horrible and staff very rude. I feel they should privatise and bump up the fee considerably From Jaipur-Amer road, a tiny road bifurcates to Nahargarh fort, the short journey of about twenty minutes is full of views of Amer, Jaipur and surrounding hills. On reaching the fort, there is a newly built structure called ‘sheesh mahal’ that contains wax statues and... The fort is hard to reach, it has nothing unique; if you've visited City palace and Amer fort, this starts to feel like a drag. Worst part is how poorly this fort is maintained - the washrooms are in bad condition; the wax museum just... We want to visit Nahargarh as it is the best place to watch the sunset over Jaipur, which it was. But we don't like that they let the palace ground to be an art exhibition. Many rooms were unavailable and those arts were not going... Total letdown. There's just some useless modern art exhibit and a couple of food stalls. They allow vehicles into the premises which ends up in havoc. They honk constantly ruining the entire visit. I'd give it a rating of zero if I could. The most popular fort in Jaipur , Rang de Basanti movie tool this place to another level. I visited very late at night or you could say early morning around 3am. Make sure when you visit at this time you're in a group. Can't say... Well worth a walk up to Nahargarh Fort from Amber Fort - it's a lovely walk up the hill by the side of the wall - not nearly as many crowds or foreigners as Amber Fort. The fort itself commands superb views of Amber Fort... The view of the sunset over Jaipur from the Fort is spectacular, especially as once the sun has set little pinpricks of light come on in the town as the citizens switch on their electric lights. Worth a trip. Visited here for a couple of hours and if I'm honest was a bit underwhelmed.  Out of the three forts I visited,  Amber and Jaigur being the others it was my least favourite.   Although not mobbed with people it was fairly busy and entrance was... Please start your journey from Nahargarh Fort as it located at the highest point and you get a composite ticket @300 rupees for indian. You can avail this ticket at many other monuments. You may save your money. Come only for panaromic view if jaipur... One of the beautiful  forts in Jaipur..around 30 km from the Jaipur city..Entrance gate is beautiful and you can enjoy fruit chat and other sweet and salty eatables at the entrance gate..Inside you can view the Jaipur city from one point...Restaurant is there...hoverboard riding facility... The fort is awesome .it fantastic i have been there many times.Nice place to have a Photography session  .City of jaipur can be seen to ever corner from here ,,it have a hotel too  on its terrace its terrace is awesome For photography  many people... There is reason why I asked to enter this fort 2 n a half Hours before sunset. 

1. First enter the Sheesh Mahal (Glass Palace), which is indeed very beautiful. Its well maintained Mahal which glitters like diamond. Entry fees is 500 INR per head.... This fort has got its own appeal with the locals. Many people come to the outer periphery for magnificent views of sun rise. For tourists and travelers , the main attraction is the breath taking view of Jaipur city offered by this fort. There are... This fort has been very intelligently built by the Maharaja. You can get a view of whole Jaipur from this place. The one thing that's very enticing is the Sheesh Mahal. You will be surprised to see how it was built. It's a beautiful place.... We got up there by tuktuk for the sunset and it was definitely worth it. There is the general entry fee of 200nrp which is ok. There seems to be another view point at the very end where you can get an even better view... We avoided the additional wax museum and sheesh mahal so I can't speak to that but the overlooks on the perimeter off to the right near the ticket booth before you walk in towards the actual fort entry. Climb up and take a look at... The wax museum and shesh mahal tour was very disappointing as it looked like a film studio. Not worth!

The fort itself is a true beauty ! Must see in Jaipur. You can go in TukTuk also. Gaint tank on the top of the fort was nice. Worth visiting and enjoy the chill during winter. Instead of taking an expensive taxi up the mountain, you can take a meter taxi to the foot of the mountain ( not 100% sure what the residential area is called). Its a very tedious climb but good excercise if you are up for it.... Amazing Fort! Lovely in the morning time! There are many forts all around India but this is truly a gem. Don't forget to have a stroll in the garden. (-°-) This fort is nice and quieter than Amber Fort. It also has amazing views of Jaipur. But DO NOT walk along the wall at the fort! There are TONS of unfriendly monkeys and they only have a warning sign on one end of the wall.... This fort is definitely worth a visit. It’s charm is in the natural state it is in. Must visit the rooftop for a beautiful and unique view of the rooftop itself. The one-hour audio tour with William Dalrymple (my favorite travel writer of India) chatting with the maharaja and his family - gave us ample opportunity to explore every nook and cranny of this wonderful, authentic, slightly crumbling fort/ palace.
We had a massive room -... We wanted to get away from the bigger Amber Fort so visited here. It was a lovely place to visit and explore with good views of the city. Recommend for something different! Nahargarh is located along the Aravalli hills overlooking a beautiful lake. There is a food court and a restaurant at the top of the fort with an excellent view, Padao. The fort now also is home to the Jaipur wax museum and glass palace. Nahargarh... The Nahargarh fort in Jaipur is located in view of the Amber Fort. Although not as frequently visited by tourists as the Amber fort, this fort is definitely a must visit place in Jaipur. It houses the largest cannon in India. One can also drive... Very very nice photo I am first time seeing this type food in the best thing in this world inside very big Canon I am not seen before like this I am really happy Went here early in the morning as recommend by our hotel, wow! Watching the sunrise above the city of Jaipur from Nahargarh is one sight I will forever remember and cherish. Nothing great about it except some shows organised there and sheesh mahal..food joints are avilable outside the fort unlike amer fort...it is not maintained properly and u can skip it if you dont have time.. #travelpost

Nice place to enjoy the day We walked up the old, steep pedestrian route, and I was already a little unwell and dehydrated due to a stomach upset.
It was 36 degrees and as it was morning, there was very little shade. If you plan to walk up, I would suggest... Presently converted to a gallery of modern art and sculptures, the fort no longer quenches the thirst of the Jaipur traveller. It has lost its old world charm and only has a birds eye view of the city.
The Wax Museum and Sheesh Mahal are... If you love history and the historical sights, then head to this fort for it's amazing architecture and history. Each section of this fort has a different story to tell and you will be all mesmerized by the designs. Located far away from Jaipur best time to visit this fort is around sunset as one would get good view of the city of Jaipur from sunset set point. Adventurous road to reach to the fort. Once you have been to the Amber fort, the rest of the forts around Jaipur are simply dwarfed and not worth seeing... I felt like I wasted time and money going here. If you want to get the awesome view of city, must visit nahargarh fort. Awesome fort and awesome place to spent Situated on Hills outside Jaipur approx. 22 km this Fort gives you the best Arial view of Jaipur city. Big fort and well maintained.

The views from this fort are amazing and it is really worth getting a guide (despite my reluctance at other attractions) as there are few information boards. Nahargarh fort is small but nice. It has 7 chowks or pravesh, each are interconnected and to terrace as well. Different chowks has different stories to tell. The architecture of building is beautiful. Entire jaipur city can been seen from here. In entrance there is... Great place to visit if you are interested in military history, it’s main attraction was the “largest” cannon built, with an intricate way of getting fresh water to the troops. This place was the barracks for the Amber Fort. I went there to watch a sunset and it is so nice. Beautiful scene with an observation point to see the whole city. Honestly, give it a miss. If it wasn't the lack of any signs to guide you or the lack of informational signs describing what you were seeing it was the absolute lack of tourism skills by the staff. It seemed I was there to serve... Yesh this is the place good to go in morning 5-6am with friends and couple prking price aprox 10 rs and good to visit at morning or at diwali night time you can see full jaipur form this fort and perfect view While as a fort it's average , it's location is what makes it a must visit on your trip to Jaipur.

We chose to visit this fort and we do not regret it. The view from the roof top is amazing, we had lunch at the restaurant and there were monkeys walking in front of the windows, it is really a special place. The Fort is well maintained.

For sheesh mahal they charge Rs. 550/- extra, which is very high. 

Monsoon season makes this fort a delightful spot. I just love this place and watching whole jaipur from... One can have a nice day spend or evening. Wax museum is added attraction along with a new restaurant. At this time of the year, in rainy season, one can sure enjoy the beauty of jaipur along with the good food. This is very old palace and the only thing to see is that from top of fort we can see full view of Jaipur city. other than that there's nothing much to see in Nahargarh fort. So whole jaipur is amazing and the journey  from Jal mahal to Nahargarh is really amazing. The view is breathtaking. 
When visit please take a guide along so that Guide will tell what is why and stories of past of Kings who lived there and... Famously known for the fort where the shot rang de basanti shooting, an avid fan of that film as soon as I landed in Jaipur I was excited to visit that place.

Amazing place with an awesome scenic view. This fort has a beautiful view of Jaipur below. It has been turned into a bit of a tourist trap though- statue exhibits, wax museum, and food court. For me, it wasn’t worth the 200INR entrance fee that foreigners must pay. Nahargarh fort, great and beautiful tourist destination, we all like the place , a must visit place enjoyable , superb I visited Jaipur last year and this year too.
The interiors of this fort are being ruined by placing garbage under the so-called guide of 'modern art' and sign boards of corporates 'adopting' this fort inorder to 'maintain' it.
What a farce!
Collecting so much... Best sunset! We had chicken and beer as we watched the sunset! It was beautiful! The way the light catches the mountains is incredible. Defiantly visit It's great fort on the Aravalli Hills overlooking our pink city of India, Jaipur.
Best time to visit is in the evening to see Sunset which makes this Fort worth watching. I was taken to this fort by a colleague when we went visiting a client nearby and though I am not a Fan of historical venues,  the Fort's magnitude, location and upkeep took my breath away. 
The view is awesome and makes one think how... Nahargarh fort is located on one of the highest (if not the highest) points of Jaipur. It takes some 1 hour to reach the top from center of Jaipur.

Was a great place and provides great view of the city.

The Amer fort displays better ""sheesh"" work.-- I feel. The Cannon as well as all the other places in the Fort were amazing. But be ready to spare an entire day for the Fort if ever you want to explore it to the fullest.

Was very crowded on independence Day. The fort itself is nice enough, it had some interesting art works in there which was actually more the highlight.

This houses 9 similarly built living area which can be today's 1room apartment,  only it's grand in scale. This is built by some king for its 9 wives. That's about it. If you want to see sun setting... There are three forts near jaipur Amer Jaigad n nahargad... this fort has wax museum sheesh mahal and biggest cannons and huge area for a sunny day This fort offers an amazing view whether you go at morning or evening or night. One of the best place in Jaipur. Also as it is a quite place, it is quite popular among couples, friends and family. This a good sunny day activity . The fort is good. There are cannon. However this place is famous for big cannons which we missed to see.  There is a restaurant as well and the place is maintained well. The guides are value for money. Nice fort with a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and European architecture.  The views of the city from the fort are spectacular.  You can drive right up to the fort.  There is a wax museum inside the fort.  Overall and good experience One thing I can assure you travellers is that when u went to nahargarh fort in the night you guys will be fall in love with the view literally .
It's so so beautiful you can't resist to shout out .
Highly recommended in jaipur... Best for couples or frnds who want to spend evening at a quite place. Tourism dept controls the place. They charge entry of 100 Rs per head. Food is limited menu high priced and low on taste. Outside eatables and liquor not allowed. But liquor... I liked the tank kept at the entrance of the palace. However, the restaurant at the back is not necessary. This place is just amazing and very beautiful. City view from this place are just beautiful and it is place where we can visit here with friends family and this place is for all age groups of people . Beautiful place we had lot of... It is a prove of the Kingdom of kings in jaipur..it is a attractive place ever. We can enjoy here in every season About 20 odd km from Amber fort. It used to house 9 queens of a king and was built as his Harlem. Take a guide - negotiate - between Rs 100-200. You get nice views of the city of Jaipur. Each queen had a set... One of the options with days tours in Jaipur which can be avoided... Too much of walk for kids and nothing to explore except the view... The only point worth seeing inside the fort is the mahendra palace of which the courtyard is beautiful. Apart from that, there is india's first wax museum for which the ticket is very expensive so we skipped it. It's really awsm place, make feel about the history. Awsm monuments. Enjoyed the naturally developed environment. If you are interested in wax museum and sheesh mahal then only visit this place..otherwise it is waste of time..nothing much about this place We took an uber up to the fort, the driver decided to wait as the road is a long winding difficult track all the way up. We did tell him to end the trip and start a new one when we were done. It was... Nahargarh fort is really a nice place.. the view from the top of the fort is just awesome .. it is a must-see place near jaipur... Lol this the one of amazing which have never touch or seeing beside me I took picture with it also love seeing it beside me before I see this on movies an this d first time being there. We started ( 2 adults and 2 kids) from Delhi at 11.00 am and reached Nahargarh directly at 4.00pm, The connecting road is smooth, well built and has real nice views.We found good number of Tourist but it was not so crowded. We parked the... Take the walking route from the city; steep and long, but great views. The fort itself is well worth a visit - and very few tourists seem to make it. The journey to the Nahargarh Fort is thrilling. You need to drive through the Aravalli foot hills. The fort is located at one edge of the Aravallis.  Built in yellow sandstone, the structure is beautiful. Stunning views of Jaipur city is seen from the fort. The fort is well maintained and provides some exotics views that are worth capturing ... the ingenuity of rajputs is visible all across and is a must see .... the only challenge is it is a physically intense place to visit Fort has good view if city. well maintained 9 queens residence. Good water harvesting tanks and small shop for sarees. Just like any other palace, it can be skipped. It is a small palace. Very approachable from Amer Palace  but do not take an Uber or Ola to this place because it does not take you all the way to the Palace, it drops you... It feels elevated to look at something which is below your eye level.... One feels being on the Top of the world... This is one of that place where u can have  a city with history of 500  years  just below you. 

Best time to... What a fantastic place to be! Stunning vista...beautiful café....interesting buildings and amusing monkeys!! The drive out was further than we expected but well worth it! This Fort was the last stop for the day after Amer and Jaigarh, and it was above the Pink City. You can clearly see Jantar Mantar from the Nahargarh Fort. The Palace is almost like a large house, and the rooftop is beautiful. It would... I can't say too much about the Fort itself, they've put a wax museum in it recently but go beyond the palace - beautiful in pictures and with great views - and see the step well and then even further to the little bar/restaurant called... One should visit this fort just half and hour before Sunset. Post sunset and dark night view will take in heaven. Must try restaurant on the top for dinner. Nahargarh Fort is a must visit place if you are a lover of culture & history. Nahargarh Fort has a canon which is the main attraction. Overall a heritage structure ruined before it's time due to lack of maintenance. Best place to visit in Jaipur because of Best view and historical place . You will enjoy nahargarh fort during early morning . It has its own charm. Hindi film Rang De Basanti was shot here. Special attraction here is the Padao Restaurant which remains open from 10 am to 10 pm. It is a good place to explore old indian majestic life style. Fort is situated on a hill  away from city and in peace, parking is huge and there is per person ticket at the entrance. 

A private wax museum in the same premises is... Located at hight. 30 to 45 min walk to reach the top. Bollywood movie Rang de Basanti has been shot here. Big, Huge and you can go for an elephant ride to visit it. Gives to an insight of the might Rajpoot Empire. Highly recommended. A must visit. Senior Citizens can avoid as lot of walking. As seen in RDB the famous bawri (man made dam for rain water storage) and view of Jaipur City from Nahargarh fort was splendid. Nahargarh fort is good place  for Jaipur view from top of the fort but it just have 2 attraction one is babli and another fort only. so its ok Has not any special feature if you have seen Amber fort. 

Sunset on this fort is super super amazing. 

There is restaurant in this fort which has entry fee of 50 just to see the sunset view. Beautiful views above the City, but the fort is not nearly as interesting as the Amber Fort, or even the Jaigargh Fort. Has some interesting rooms, but mostly you're coming up for the birds-eye view of Jaipur. Takes about 30 minutes to ride up in... you can see the whole of jaipur from here, the whole pink city on side and a range of mountains by its side also it has a newly built museum with wax idols,raj mahal and most attractive sheesh mahal this is surely the shows topper...

But if you are in Jaipur with some spare time in hand, you can visit this. It was built for defense purpose... Amazing fort and the palace within the fort is also worth a visit. There is a wax museum and sheesh Mahal within the fort that has a separate entry ticket, which we did not visit for lack of time. But overall a must visit, in... Nahargarh is a fort to visit after many visits to Jaipur and you have exhausted other landmark attractions. while it is pretty with great views and interesting architectural elements, it cannot compare to Amer for example. Historical relevance and stories are interesting and it's locale... After Jaigarh and Amber, I found Nahargarh (Tiger) Fort pretty average. Most of the areas along the walls are out of bounds, infested by ""danger"" monkeys, or require additional fees to enter (e.g. the restaurant on the point). Though spartan and without much exposition, the... Fort is at the top of the hill and is usually visited after the Amber Palace. It takes about 30/40 minutes to walk around. Views on the parapets are worth the effort when we went it was fairly quiet. This one is last and farthest amongst the three forts and has great views of Jaipur. There is one telescope guy in the palace showing major attractions and we loved it. Its got apartments for 9 queens and the king, complete with separate kitchens. servant quarters storage and toilets for each queen. One can have a beautiful view of Jaipur city from the roof top of this palace Except for the amusing palace with chambers for each of the Maharaja's wife, each built as the other but without direct access to one another, there's not much to see in Nahargarh. The view of Jaipur can be great if the sky is clear and... Another fort to watch for. Nahargarh has its own history to talk about. A marvelous piece of creation by Jaipur's erstwhile King's. One must visit this place for its world famous light and sound show. On the plus side, I quite enjoyed the fort.  With some imagination, it's easy to visualise its past splendour.  Some tricky stairs re around, but that's to be expected.

My issue is with the Padao Restaurant, that commands superb views over the city.  I understand... Rather visit Amber fort or Jaigarh to see the canon. This fort is filled with restaurants only.Very costly wax museum This was once a beautifully decorated fort/palace overlooking Jaipur. Unfortunately, the place has not been maintained as a historical landmark. The interior walls of the wives' apartments were originally decoratively painted but are now polluted with graffiti and carvings. The floors are littered with rubbish.... What a beautiful place it once was. It still has painted ceilings and walls but sadly they've been left to deteriorate and huge amounts of graffiti scribed all over them. However, that should not stop you visiting this fascinating fort, with so much history. The... Nice place to see after seeing amber fort, as this is a fort which rested the batallions and is somewhat different from the amber fort We were reluctant to go as we had seen so many forts in India, but glad that we did. A little different and not many people. Interesting, and not too crowded.  Best part was the weapons museum.  If you need to kill time and are in the area anyway, check it out.

You will love the murals on the walls...there is a cafe that charges 100 bucks just for entry...it money is worth it..A... You get to know a lot about the lifestyles of the King and his Queens. They had well planned architecture then. From this Fort, you can behold entire Jaipur city. Very beautiful Fort I went on my bike to the top and it was a great fun ride.

This place is outskirts of Jaipur. A new attraction has been developed inside. It has wax museum with 32 statues of Indian and International personalities , Sheesh mahal and Raj darbar.

Situated at the top of the hill, it give you a complete sight of whole Jaipur from the... The history in this fort and battlement is amazing , being there feels like you have been transported back in time.
Simply stunning. This is beautiful building inside and out. There are long corridors and many rooms, some of which overlook Jaipur. There has been a new addition since my first visit, now you can go right on the roof. The highest place in the building.

An early morning visit and then watching the sunrise from there makes it thrilling. Beware of monkeys on the way.

The fort was calm and one can move around looking inside it. We didn't hire a... The Fort itself is average, but you can have a great view of the city from here.

All mahals have same architecture and a common roof. you need to hire a car to ride you up or you can go on feet but i think that would be realy difficult.we enjoyed the evening snacks on the resturant created in the fort arena and the view of sunset here was breathtaking beautiful.

one must take steps and walk till the entry gate
from there u will get ride in 30 rs. per pax till the top...nice experience...
try to avoid road as it costly.... Do visit for scenic beauty and if you are fort lover.
And yes - the Rang De basanti - famous jump spot ;) Much smaller than its more famous counterpart in Jaipur, the Amber Fort, Nahargarh Fort offers equally good views from the top, but it is much less beautiful and opulent. The advantage is that you dont have to do any climbing, as you can easily take... Much modern the architectural design is very interesting. The decorations on the different rooms are wonderful though very badly kept. The elephants painted on the entrance patio walls are worth the visit. Jaigarh fort is another palace which is being used by old kings to hunt the tigers. This fort is comprising of 9 mehals which are identical and similar to each other so better to visit only one. You can see the view of jaipur from... Jaigarh fort is another palace which is being used by old kings to hunt the tigers.

We got a taxi up to the fort and walked out to the bar at the end (past the fort entrance) and then set sipping our beer as we looked out over the city as the sun came down - magical!

It also gives a amazing...... view of the city Jaipur...... Though the fort is not well maintained, but has a fantastic view of the Pink city, specially in the night The view of the city from the top of the fort is good. That apart, there is nothing in there. Jaighad & Amer forts are more important than this. when we talk about jaipur  amer fort nahargarh and jaigarh fort can't be missed . they all can be covered in one day and is a must visit . nahargarh for was the last one i visited tht day and was their till late evening... This was a nice palace inside the fort overlooking Jaipur.  Great views of course.  The palace itself contains 9 apartments for the queens.  All beautifully decorated with wonderful murals.  Actually the whole palace has fanastic murals and is well worth seeing.  We had lunch in...

After seeing Amer and Jaigarh fort one might get bored but Nahargarh fort is still worth a visit.
It has got some of the best views of Jaipur city from the top. Nice place to spend some time.

And as usual not so good maintenance,... The Tiger Palace is visited mainly by young locals, rather a picnick than a museum visit. This I found very interesting.

We visited it after the Amber fort and we enjoyed alot being here. First, you get spectacular views over Jaipur from here. Second, I...

We sat outside on the terrace overlooking the city.....the noises of talking, chattering can be heard from the city yet you are miles from it..... Quite an experience.

The palace is... It is really good because of location, architecture, history and view. Awesome landscape of Jaipur city. Worth a visit. Also, like the restaurant - Not so many choices but food was really good. Alcohol is also available so .... The fort Nahargarh is also a nice piece of arctitecture famouse for suites which were designed for Queens of the King. All the suites are same. Well planned fort where the rain water is stored after cleaning.
It also gives a great view of the... It is one of the best monument of jaipur which describe the great jaipur.It is well maintained fort of jaipur it is neat and clean with the facilities.This gives a very good view of jaipur Unfortunately we visited in January and there was a lot of haze and fog so not very good views. Perhaps on a crystal clear day, if that even exists in India, we would have scored this higher. After the other 2 forts we found this... Awesome spectacle of Jaipur beneath the fort. The restaurant is at the end of the fort has a fantastic feel to it. Service could be better and they could definitely take care of people throwing plastic around the place. Otherwise a memorable visit. Its not just the fort but the drive up to it. Specially after the monsoon rains or during the winters. The fort offers a breathtaking view of the Pink City. A place that will please the heart of any romantic. Head out there post lunch... if u want to see Jaipur in a nutshell, or if u want to capture whole of Jaipur in a shot dont forget to visit this place. Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the pink city of Jaipur. It has the most spectacular view of Pink City. It is right next to the Jaigarh fort. The fort was constructed as a place of retreat on the summit... We went up here on a lovely warm Sunday morning, although it was a long ride to the top (make sure your rickshaw driver drives you the whole way you would not want to walk this!) The fort was pretty big and the views are... Took a cab up here after 5pm as didn't know it was closed. The sights from the top were special but with the museum closed and darkness descending we were limited in our scope of things to do see. There is a restaurant/ bar up... A grand old place that has undergone some restorative work since we were last here and looks so much the better for it. Needs an audio guide and ordescriptive placards. The road up is amazing. Windy, potholed and more. When you go to amber fort, you can pay a visit to nahargarh too but dont go specially. its ok but not worth the extra at least 2 hours it will take specially if you are in jaipur for a short trip Definitely worth a visit. 

A nice long mountain drive leads to this fort. After visiting Amer, a visit to Nahargarh is the next logical step. Try your hand at flying kites from this place. Personally did that after a long time and enjoyed it to... This place is also know as Tiger Fort. The view through the small windows and from the roof top was amazing. I could never forget the great feelings I had during my visit here, thanks to King Man Singho for making this such great fort. The fort is very large and we didn't bother to pay to enter as we felt we saw enough on the grounds and walk up I?ts good fort but there is not  much to see on the fort. 
only worls big "" TOF"" is there to see.
its really big otherwise. all you can see the wall around the hill like china wall. After visiting Amer and Jaigarh, visit to Nahargarh is next logical step to fully appreciate the lifestyle of the royals in those days who perhaps did not travel much for leisure as they created their own resorts like Nahargarh....

This fort is noteworthy for some... We found this fort to be alright. The place is maintained decent enough to be kept open for visitors.
The walk around was good. There is an open restaurant as well, which was seen empty.
Do go all the way to the top. It looks... The main attraction of this fort is that Rang De Basanti was shot here. Unlike Jaigarh Fort, there is not much to see within the premises, but the drive to the fort offers amazing views of Jaipur city - in fact that alone makes this...

The fort is very large and we didn't bother to pay to enter as we felt we saw enough on... The fort here is not in itself worth a visit compared to others, but the view over Jaipur, which you can see without entering the fort, is lovely.The journey up had good views as well. If you have time visit If you are in Nahargarh try to get in there before sun set. Sun set here is awesome . From the fort it gives you bird eye view of jaipur city. A must visit place during your trip to jaipur. the best part was that i trkeed the entire way up. and dint used a cab. there are 2 access to the fort. try seeking lcoal assistance in getting through the Back access of fort, and you can trk it up. its a semi finished... I thought I was fit , and Our auto guy told us it would take 10-15 mins to scale up , But my word it was a struggle mostly because we under estimated how much it was . Beautiful views from the top roof restaurant... UNESCO heritage, and that in itself says it all! We arrived, parked, our guide shows us the way of entry, queue, pay and enter. Immediately remain fascinated by the view of the Blue City, Jodhpur, incredible in itself, ritual photos and ""climb"" to the huge... We went in the middle of the day, but I bet sunset here would be absolutely breathtaking. If you can squeeze Nahargarh Fort into your trip, it is highly suggested! It was middle of the day when we visited the fort. We were pretty tired and over heated so I will save my best judgement for when I can visit again, during evening time. We were told the fort, also called 'Tiger Fort' ,is great... You can see for miles from the Nahargarh Fort whose name means abode of tigers.  This was built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II who also built the City Palace.  This fort along with the Jaigarh Fort and the Amer Palace created a...

Looked more like a haveli to me, Nevertheless beautiful inside

The combination ticket is cheaper as compared to tickets taken... Well, I love the beautiful windows and the corridors where the movie Sudh desi romance was shot. The view of the Jaipur city was breathtaking. The fort is gud and one can view whole jaipur from the top of this place . the only option to go there is by car.. it is very near to jaigarh fort. one can club amber,jaigarh n nahargarh fort together. This was a magnificent view of the city but it is not the most treasured of the sites to visit. So if you do not have time you can leave this one out. We viewed it at night and it made everything look so clean... Another must visit place, Situated high on the mountain. Some of the top Bollywood movies had covered this place e.g. Rang de basanti.  The biggest attraction is the Great cannon and the amazing building. Thought the place is lonely and however one does not fell... way to nahargarh fort from amer fort 15 km. by road ,excellent journey ,you see king palace,& see whole jaipur from height,to see sunset from this fort are excellent This is one place which is a must visit at night time !!!!

Best time to visit is around sunset wherein one can enjoy the breeze along with little... The  best part of this fort is the scenic view of Jaipur. We did Nahargarh, Jaigarh and Amer together in one trip and  i think its best to  do it that way. Great views of Jaipur...didn't try the restaurants. Not much of heritage value.  Combine it with Jaigarh fort and Amer Nahargarh Fort also know as Rang De Basanti fort is located on a hill and is not as popular as Amber fort within tourists. But if you are looking for an aerial view of Jaipur then Nahargarh is must visit. Best time to visit the...

After visiting city palace and hawa mahal and most of all amber fort, this is like a glass of water in a bucket. Not bad, but why would you go for the glass when you have the bucket. Go there if you really really love... We visited at night, just before closing, so we didn't have too much time but the view from the fort over the Pink city was gorgeous. all the lights, colors and sounds. Perfect. It is a steep climb if you decide to walk, but the view along the way is nice. But be warned--this place is not safe for female travellers.  Enter at your own risk. very dirty and neglected fort.good only for its city view from hill top.there is a restaurant inside fort serving alcohol full day, which has attracted wrong kind of people over there spoiling tourist  experience . definately not a place for family and girls. after visiting... Excellent views of Jaipur from this fort. Come up here in the late afternoon to see the fort, see the views, and watch people. Built mainly in 1734 and extended in 1868.

Best view in Jaipur and on the composite ticket so worth it. Make sure you get a tuktuk though as the walk is steep and takes ages. It's also not lit up so you'll be walking in the dark after sunset. Fort is very quiet... We did the walk from the bottom which was around 30 mins up a rather steep hill! Once at the top it really is very poorly maintained, it's filthy, walls are falling down and it feels like a ghost town. However the views over Jaipur... Not many people come to this fort. The fort is magnificent to look at. But there is nothing much of significance except for the brilliant view you get of Jaipur from there. You can also see Jal Mahal from that height. Nahargarh Fort is placed high above the city so that you have a nice view on it (especially at night).
We went to the Fort at Diwali and could see all the Fireworks at night. On the rooftop you can also find a restaurant were... Living in India for about 2 yrs already, this is definitely my most favorite and romantic place so far. One should go there about 7pm when it is already dark. The taxi will take you right on top. 
It's an experience on its own even... Be aware that a lot of the other reviews saying the site is being converted into a hotel or that the only thing worth it is the views is mixing are mixing the site with another one: there is a lot more to see than... The most popular Jaipur attractions are the heritage palaces and forts, with elaborate architecture that serves as a glorious reminder of their royal legacy. 
Nahargarh was mostly used as a residence by the Kachawas rulers, especially by the maharanis during the hot summer months. Nahargarh... Only thing worth is the view. The worst thing is that even water is not available easily. That makes it a bad experience all in all. The sunset view was really good though. Wouldn't go again. We came here for sunset and the views were spectacular. As a fort, it's not a patch on nearby Amber and Junagargh, but grabbing a drink atop your own private battlement (possibly the weirdest restaurant I've ever been to) as the sun sets over Jaipur... There is nothing hear. It is not worth the visit. It is now being converted into a hotel. Better to give it a miss This place was a little gem for scenery. The top of the main building having the best panoramic views. Don't be put off by the bad stories of going up alone. In my experience it was all fine. And a good idea to head up... After being disappointed at Amber, we visited Nahargarh fort, at around 4:30 in the evening. I had already heard so much about the sunset view from here and was very keen to witness that. And it was definitely a spectacular view....the view from Padav is... The best thing about the Tiger Palace is you can have a decent lunch here, accompanied with a beer if you choose.
There are no displays explaining what went on here, but rather some local staff who, for a 'tip', not a fee, are happy... A very different kind of fort with apartment like feel for queens.
The deep and wavy stepped pond is great andworth to look for a while. In Nahargarh you will find an impressive collection of very big cannons and even more impressive cannon balls. While you marvel them you walk around at the highest point of Jaipur with a nice view, fresh air. There are even some refreshment places. 
As I... Nahargarh is a very good place which is on the hills of the amer fort. Here you can enjoy the beauty of nature. A bar and restorent is available near the fort on the hills from where you can see the view of Jaipur City.... Just come up here for the views of the city, a little wander around the palace and then leave. It's not really interesting in itself, just brilliant views.

This fort seems different with a unique feel and is located at a higher altitude in the Aravali Hills... I was not given very favorable review about this palace.

Remote location had been here at night by rtdc night tour . Just a good view of the city and a better dinner It is on the outskirts of Jaipur and is very good. Go only if you have a lot of time, no point otherwise, there are better places even though this is good. While initially we were going to get an autorickshaw up here, common sense prevailed and we ended up getting a car. Which was good, because the road is kind rough and windy.

Once you get up there though, the view is totally incredible. Come up... I have spent initial 10 years of my life in our ancestral house on Nahargarh Road. From the house, the fort is not more than 30 minutes of walk. So I have seen it changing its colours from bright golden to post 'Rang de basanti'...

The drive upto Nahargarh is a beautiful one, if you go around the sunset time, you can get a beautiful view of the setting sun just before the fort gate or then at a chattri when you get inside the complex.

Beautiful Ariel view of the Jaipur city. Simply Amazing. Specially at night. The place have a restaurant also named "" Padao "" which is run by... Nice architecture, you can feel the local history when you visit the place; like many other places in India. Valid to visit and take a lot of pictures. Words are not enough to describe Nahargarh Fort. An excellent place to spend some quality time, but alas! it is very poorly maintained, like all other Indian places of interest. Had it been in any other country, they would have developed it like anything and would have made it a must visit destination! After seeing Jaigarh & Amer this place was frankly a huge disappointment. Nothing exclusive, plus it's poorly maintained. The place houses whole lot of monkeys and keeping away from them was a task in itself. The only good part was the drive. You can surely... Sad to say but the most neglected spot of Jaipur. First pathetic service and food, second risky as hell.. Govt only wakes for 2-3 days after any accident and then again they go and sleep at home. Full of rowdy bike riders risking their own... Nahargarh is one beautiful fort in the region of Jaipur which acted as one of the strong defense ring for the city of Jaipur during the ruling times of Sawai Man Singh. The view of the city from Nahargarh is fabulous and breathe taking.

Jaigarh... It has 9 identical rooms for the 9 queens. Nothing much to see and can finish it up within 15 minutes. The fort is OK but cannot be compared with Amber and Jaigarh fort.
Tip: Purchased a convenient combo-ticket, which covered Jantar Mantar, Amber fort,... Visit Nahargarh at the end of day, after Amer and Jaigarh, just in time for the sunset over the city of Jaipur.

Visit the place just as the sunsets and enjoy the... It was amazing experience as we saw Jaipur city standing atop of this fort. Amazing view of the city and the cricket ground. Nahargarh fort is an amazing experience and is situated en route to Amer fort. Loved it's architecture. This is the third major fort in Jaipur after Amber and Jaigarh fort.

There is a cafe too which serves soft drinks, tea and light refreshments. 
A... It is more like a haveli, with really great view of Jaipur City. It was a palace for 9 queens as told by guide. There are two eating joints, which is not worth of money.

The fort is well looked after and has a restaurant in one of the courtyards but this place is best visited for its stunning views... Sadly, very poorly maintained.

The moment you open the window fresh breeze is experienced .
The fort is really good Visit to Nahargarh fort is memorable for me.It was decorated and crowded on that day as shooting of some movie/serial was going there..the view of Jaipur from fort is amazing.I enjoyed it. This fort in spectacular and so are the surrounding views. It also is by a wildlife preserve where you will see elephants and peacocks, and some rescued lions and tigers. Very tranquil setting. We did a quick stop here. Unfortunately not well maintained like Amer. The tank at the entrance (of the Rang De Basanti fame!) is a nice place to spend some time at Nahargarh fort is a wonderful fort worth visiting despite being rated behind Amber and Jaiharh forts in Jaipur.
The main problem with this fort is the lack of proper maintenance. The is no security man/watch guard in most part of the fort which allows some... Its a task to you up the hills just to see 9 identical rooms for  the 9 rani's :(. I mean  thats about it it was really disappointing. It's a nice architecture with attention to the detail. The best thing that we saw and that made the most impression on me where a group of Indian ladies dressed in their bright beautiful costumes!!! Such a beauty! Nice view of the city, but avoid if you are short of time, i guess we would have better picked the Jaigarh fort as we wanted to see the amber fort from top. not much to do apart from viewing the city from different angles A good fort. A great place to after you have done with your other city tourist places. 
Read through the writings as this makes a fort visiting experience complete. An added advantage is the great views.

In the afternoon reach Nahargarh and enjoy a thali... I hate to give this place a poor rating but overall compared to the other two forts on this three fort tour this one is a downer. Upkeep is low and the place is kind of run down. Was fun to be able to climb... The location is perfect, the setting is perfect, the ambience is what you always wanted. For those who seek seclusion and just want to spend some private moments with the loved one, it is an ideal place. The view of Jaipur City is amazing. Drive... Not an inspiring fort. Lots of garbage and construction material lying around. The palace is nice but without much information about the place. Parts of the palace stink. 

The sunset view point is just an elevation with a great view of Jaipur city - which... High up above Jaipur is the Tiger Fort. Great views across Jaipur from there.

If you're going to the Amber fort then it's worth... Wow.. the way to fort is adventurous and exciting with sharp curves and valley crossing.

A good fort but need not be a must see.See if time permits.Not much of architecture.But generaly clubbed with jaifarh fort The views make this fort worth the visit (especially if you're up there during Diwali when the fireworks lay carpets of colour beneath you). Don't be fooled by the look-out restaurant though, you've no need to pay to see the view: head around the side... A fort with nine apartments.  Par of the day visit with Amer fort. Historically significant. Similarly designed Apartments are built in the fort.

The views were fantastic,... The fort itself is not so interesting from the architectural point of few; however, the road to the top of the mountain where it's located is very picturesque. Don't forget to bargain with the rikshaw drivers! And ask your driver to stop in a few... Maintained old fort; close to Jaigarh fort.
Similar sort of 9 build ups. One small cafeteria on top.
2-3 cannons kept in front.
If one has covered Amber palace and Jaigarh fort, this fort appears of to be of lesser profile.
Nothing special The palace here was nothing in comparison to Amber Fort, however the sunset view from the close by cafe is worth seeing. You do have to wonder around a bit to find the cafe and when there they do charge a small entry fee which... Beautiful place but not well maintained. Beautiful view of Jaipur city from around the walls of the fort.

really it was awesome to go there and see the... There is nothing great about this fort especially if you compare it the ones around it. but you can visit the site where RDB was shot. The Nahargarh Fort, standing at a distance from Amer and Jaigarh, is another Unique and Picturesque historical masterpiece, however, sadly only a portion of the fort, which is the Mahal for the 12 rani's, are open for Tourists.

Just go at evening around 6 its a 9Km drive from bottom to top, surrounded by greenery and breath taking roads to the top.
On reaching top there is a restaurant named ""Padao"" from there whole jaipur can be seen during rainy season this place... This is maitained very poorly. I could see bad social elements, in the area. Myself & my family was taken back, to see this in a tourist location which is famous. There is nothing much to see & maitenance is very very poor its nothing Just a small villa , nothing to see a big open hall with some rooms on 3 sides and a water reservoir outside! entry fee Rs. 10/- Shame this place isn't what it could be. Filthy dirty, seems locals can't use garbage bins provided. This could be amazing with some attention spent on cleaning it up and stopping the grafitti This is my 3rd visit & I`m surprised to see that PADAO restaurant now serves only Drinks & Snacks ( Dinner no longer served there )
View & Wind was as good as always but staff had turned rude.

Go with your food, or with the a plan to... I really lked Nahargarh Fort (much more than Amber Fort!) It was peaceful and whilst it is in itself so very beautiful, the views are simply breathtaking.

Go with a bunch of friends. there is a restaurant as well that serves food and drinks. it always has a good weather This is a wonderful place @ outskirts of Jaipur. At night, it boasts of a excellent view from the top which leaves one speechless !!! One of the best scenes i have ever seen at night. The best views of the Pink City can be found from the Nahargarh Fort. It's worth the effort to go all the up there and plan to spend some time wandering around to enjoy the views. Also the restaurant makes it a great place to... Nahargarh is bit away from the main city, but worth a visit. You can look forward for views of Jaipur from any of the 2 restaurants on the fort, one serves drinks, snacks and other dinner and drinks.

The view is magnificent, and there are... Get there just before the sun sets and sit on the terrace with a cold beer and some warm companions and enjoy a spectacular sunset over the entire city.  From here you see just how encircled Jaipur is by mountains, with desert sands encroaching on... Terrible. You are better off sleeping in your room. There is practically nothing to see. Just empty rooms. You will be thoroughly disappointed. Lovely fort but In poor repair.  Grafte everywhere and generally grotty.  Such a pity.  Still worth a visit.  Like everywhere in India be prepared for the heat and for a walk.
Not many visitors there which makes a change! Great place to get your bearings and a perspective of the Jaipur chaos. The fort itself isnt as big or spectacular as Amber fort, but its on the way (i think) so deff worth a stop.

Much better than alot of other sites in the city and you can even see the arch of one of the instruments at Jantar Mantar observatory from here. Gained popularity after ""Lagaan"".

The windows to allow in cool breeze and sunlight is worth appreciating. Mughal and Indian Architecture combination... I visit Nahargah every month, one of the best place to hangout with friends, amazing road and marvelous atmosphere on the top. I've been to Nahargarh Fort a number of times, but never ventured into the open air restaurant.  On Choti Diwali I decided to go in.  Wish I'd been there in time for the sunset, but my main goal was to enjoy the lights below.  The... Do visit this place to get a nice view of jaipur from the edge.Gr8 place for picnics.
Girls beware anti social elements around, so go in groups.
Otherwise nice to roam and see the 7 princess palace. We took a car to the palace. It was built to give a number of queens  their own separate accommodation within one palace. What were the suites for the Queens are all the same size so it is possible to feel a bit confused but... We visited the fort after seeing Amber fort.

Give your self at least 3-4 hours to take in all this place offers. Durg Cafeteria at Nahargarh Fort as people were openly drinking at this place and we were feeling a liitle surprised that there was no policeman at such historic place and how drinking is allowed at such a famous tourist destination, young people were just getting... We decided to take the 30 minute climb from the city to the fort rather than the several kilometer but easier drive.

Once there, the views over Jaipur are good. The Fort is of passing interest but not in the same league as Amber or... There is a great view of the city of Jaipur from here.  A cafe can refresh you after your trip up the mountain, but don't expect great service.  The mountain road is probably extra dangerous after dark since most of the tourists stopping there have...

However, the view from the windows are... A very nice fort, if you have time to visit its worth it. Dirty, very poorly organised, lot of hooligans. One feels unsafe.  The signposts are non existant. Traffic is chaotic. The approach road is broken in many places. The walls are defaced This fort is a deal to get into at 30 rupees and the price reflects the fact that it is undergoing restoration. This however does not take away from the granduer of this site. It is a massive fort and is higher up the mountain... All the past grandeur of Rajput style of living is visible here, the battlements commanding the land around, the lookouts, the view down on Amber fort, the tank, the huge cannon, the palace and apartments, take you back to a bygone world This large fort palace was very enjoyable.  The views down over Jaipur were incredible and there were many interesting details - like fireplaces made in England.  Good murals and above all virtually no one there!

In jaipur if there is one thing not to be missed at all its the ambiance of the... but a great one if you have not seen much of forts in your life like me. There is a lot of work pending at the site and the fort can be better maintained and exhibited well. The cafe here is able to easily serve... Though all the forts in in Jaipur after a while look pretty much same but they all have different flavors with super rajatasthani architecture and huge area. Must visit . I am glad i went Most terrible fort we visit in Inida. It is in the composite ticket (also amber fort) so you dont have to pay any fee if you have that ticket. It is just a big concrete building in the shape of a fort. On every wall... Nahargarh is something thats a further continuation of Jaigarh fort. Unlike jaigarh, which is a proper fort, nahargarh is a Maharaja's palace. They have 9 apartments. Visit for the monument. massive walls/views.  lots of tunnels/rooms for kids to explore, very scenic. very few people our day, so it was an immersive experience.   i'd recommend walking from the car park, too short and scenic for elephants or jeep rides to be necessary. Nahargarh Fort is the third fort in a row along with Amber & Jai Garh Forts.. Amber was the official fort of the king, Jai Garh was built for fights and battles whereas NaharGarh was built was the Queens only.. One can view the city... An amazing historical fort that is perched on top of a hill.  Great view of the city and a lot of old historic sites to visit. Great place for views, but if you're travelling on your own use the free guide. They're on salary and not allowed to receive tips.  Some parts were under construction still using traditional techniques so don't wear your best shoes! I did both the Jaigarh and the Nargarh by taxi and it was great value as the road between them is littered with amazing views and glimpses of the city and lakes.  The fort was bestter tah the Jaigarh in that touts were almost invisible... The road to Nahargarh is narrow and is full of potholes. The most significant omission is the absence of signage leading to the great gun. One tends to drive to Nahargarh fort and museum. The staff manning the entrance are busy collecting money for vehicles... This was under a lot of construction when I visited and there were no signs. The views in winter can be very poor because of this constant haze that hangs over the city. Go there only if you have time..there is very small palace to see there and the biggest attraction for people is the Open Air Restaurant which they promote. its on the terrace of the palace, badly maintained..not recommended to go there.. I saw some of the reviews which said you could walk up to the Fort and saw some tourists walking up.  I don't think it is worth walking as the place is not visited by many and the local cabs zip through the hilly roads.... Loved to see the city from above - pretty impressive! This place gives a wonderful view of Jaipur city. It is also famous for Rang De Basanti film scene shooting (A famous Bollywood movie).
Other than that the fort didn't have anything much to offer. The haveli inside the fort is also very small, with... uncleaned, urine and garbage in inner domes...really bad place to visit..(Local lover couples have made it hell) We spent the better part of two days visiting this Fort.

Very narrow windy road upto the fort with several buses on it so you feel like you are about to drop off the edge.

The fort is rather derelict, but the palace is still in a good state.  Lots of monkeys wandering around the palace. A grand Haveli with pictureqsque view of the city. The bathing place of Queen was amqazing & the design only goes to tell how advanced thought process was so many years back. The place could be maintained well. There is a strong need to have... Has a step well and a good view of the whole scenary.
An old time well also used for swimming is also near the Fort.

The fort interiors are very small and ill maintained.

Overall - One can skip this place. No loss. This turned out to be a very small fort situated a little far from the main city. It wasnt as impressive as the City palace and the travelling time and the road were also not enjoyable. All and all, not worth the effort. It was interesting to see Jaipur spread out below us - I hadn't really appreciated just how big of a city it was. We had a couple beers and watched the sunset. The restaurant was really limited and expensive so we headed back into town... got a fantastic view of the city from the ramparts of the fort at night. With a couple of appetizers and a bottle of beer, this is a wonderful place to relax. Go there at night... Visit on sunrise or sunset! They have a nice restaurant. good place worth to spend whole day, but their restaurant is quit expensive. they charge 140 per person for buffet meal but they didnt include a single rajasthani dish in it, not even a sweet. only 4wheelers can go till entrance of the fort, those...

Bring some warm clothes as it gets cold as the... It lies in one corner of the top most point in Jaipur. One should go right on top from where from one of the jharokha's you get a spectacular view of Jaipur... We went up to Nahargarh Fort in the evening to get a different perspective on Jaipur and it is a lovely view.  It was also nice to see where Rang de Basanti (Bollywood movie) was partly filmed.  It is a real shame that the local... Great view of the city from this palace. Sings of vandalism put you off otherwise a lovely experience. A beautiful location with rooms well decorated.  The guards more interested in their phones than stopping the graffiti being written and sometimes carved into what remains.

The well now a sad sight full of bottles and plastic. Standing on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the pink city - Jaipur. The view of the city from the fort is breath taking. Along with Amber Fort and Jaigarh Fort it formed a strong defence ring for the city. During the Sepoy revolt... Well Nahargarh Fort is located at the top of a Hill in Jaipur. It is very near to Amer Fort which is the most famous tourist attraction center.

Nahargarh Fort is not as glorious as Amer fort but It has the ultimate charm of a... The Nahargarh fort is an old Fort of the Rajput rulers of Jaipur which was used as a Vacation spot by the later kings of the state. It Has a nice View of the city from its ramparts & If you are in Jaipur &... A combined place to watch rajasthan's cultural heritage and cool view of jaipur from the top. A fantastic place to see the exact location where shooting of ""Rang de basanti""'s song ""paathshaala took place"" i.e.""BAWRI"".. A great place to have fun especially in rainy season. The Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts are about 7 kilometers away from the Amer Fort and are about 5 kilometers away from each other. If you have time for only one of the two forts then it is recommended that you go to the Jaigarh Fort.... Nahargarh is what I would call a secondary tourist attraction in Jaipur. Certainly see the City Palace, Amer Fort, etc. before this one. But if you've got the time do stop by. It's both a fort with long stone walls and also contains a palace... We were nearly the only visitors one afternoon.  We enjoyed viewing each of the wives' apartments, and the views of the city were lovely.
